become_a_vegetarian;Become a Vegetarian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_a_vegetarian_desc;Perhaps it is time to refrain from eating meat and gain great merit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.1.desc;We are taught by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to be compassionate and to love all sentient beings, yet I eat meat every day. Can I truly call myself a true follower of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith if I continue to participate in this wanton murder of innocent animals? Starting now, I will refrain from eating meat, and become a vegetarian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.1.a;For all sentient beings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.2.desc;I am no longer a follower of a faith that advocates a vegetarian diet. My public practice of vegetarianism is thus no longer necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.2.a;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.3.desc;All monks must vow to abstain from eating meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.3.a;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.3.b;My sect or culture doesn’t require vegetarianism, but I’ll do it anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.3.c;My sect or culture doesn’t require vegetarianism, and I won’t do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.4.desc;Oddly enough, becoming a vegetarian was very easy for me. I don’t feel any attachment to meat at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.4.a;Maybe I was a vegetarian in my past life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.5.desc;Having a vegetarian diet isn’t the easiest thing. The temptation to eat meat is still strong, but I must continue practicing loving-kindness and compassion to all sentient beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.5.a;I will endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.6.desc;Being a vegetarian is more difficult than I expected. It’s so hard trying to resist the temptation to meat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.6.a;I don’t know how I’ll persevere, but I must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.7.desc;I can’t take it anymore. Despite the karmic rewards, being vegetarian is too difficult - my attachment to meat is too great. There is no way I can avoid eating meat…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.7.a;It’s time to eat normally again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.7.b;I must resist! I can resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.8.desc;Being vegetarian isn’t so bad, at least sometimes. Other times it’s hard to resist meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.8.a;That’s how samsara is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.9.desc;One of your courtiers is tempting you with meat. “[Root.GetTitledFirstName], you may be vegetarian, what’s the harm in eating meat once in a while? Just a taste, for fun. You can always say some prayers later to make up for it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.9.a;Right! I’ll just have a few bites of that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.9.b;No! I vowed to practice loving-kindness and compassion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.10.desc;My desire for meat is overwhelming me. I am a [Root.GetTitle], after all… no one would object if I ate a little bit of meat, and I know the perfect way to get some without attracting too much attention…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.10.a;It’s just one time… or a few…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.10.b;I will resist any such temptations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.11.desc;It seems the cook accidentally put some meat in my meal. I could ignore the meat… or I could just eat it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.11.a;It’s the cook’s fault and not mine, I’ll eat meat this one time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.11.b;The cook already made it, so I’ll eat it reluctantly as to not waste food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.11.c;Put the meat aside. I won’t be eating it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.12.desc;I am beginning to get used to my vegetarian diet. I never knew it was possible to eat a variety of foods without meat! Salty, sweet, spicy… all these flavors can still be experienced. Granted, things like beans are no substitute for real meat, but it’s not as bad as I initially thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.12.a;I’m strong to the finish, because I eat my vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.13.desc;Recently one of the local holy men gave a lecture on various topics to the nobles of my court. He said that my dedication to a vegetarian diet showed my devotion to the Dharma, and urged my courtiers to follow in my footsteps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.13.a;It’s good to hear someone approves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.13.b;I’ve done nothing great. I only wish others to be kind to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.14.desc;Now that I’m vegetarian, it saddens me when I think of the animals that are constantly slaughtered every day for food. Perhaps I should go into town, buy some of these animals and set them free. Practicing compassion doesn’t end with a vegetarian diet, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.14.a;Yes, I should do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.14.b;No, I don’t have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.15.desc;It’s difficult explaining to some why I’m a vegetarian. “Don’t you miss the taste of meat?” or “Can’t you show your religious devotion through some other means?” some might ask. Today, however, I’ve managed to convince one of my courtiers that the merits of vegetarianism are worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.15.a;It’s good to have another vegetarian around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.16.desc;My loyal subordinates fear that my vegetarian diet will leave me malnourished and frail, unable to perform my duties and manage my responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.16.a;They do have a point… but what can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.16.b;Ha! Haven’t they seen the healthy monks in the temples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.17.desc;I have been experimenting with my vegetarian diet lately, but it seems the cook and I have miscalculated the sort of foods that would nourish me. I’m suddenly feeling very fatigued - it seems like this combination of foods isn’t very good at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.17.a;If only I could eat meat again, this would be so much easier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.17.b;Looks like we’ll have to go back to the previous diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.18.desc;“Look at you meat-eaters! You’re no different from murderers!” you proudly proclaim to your courtiers, in another attempt to convince them of the merits of vegetarianism. “You’re all hypocrites, claiming to practice compassion and follow the Dharma while you continue to endorse the murder of innocents!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.18.a;That should teach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.18.b;Maybe I was too harsh, and should apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.19.desc;You didn’t notice it at first, but one of your more mischievous courtiers put some meat in your meal, and you consumed it by accident! That fool must be punished somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.19.a;Why should I be bothered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.19.b;Strongly condemn such actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.19.c;A day in the stocks should do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.20.desc;“You are vegetarian?” the foreign dignitary looks, bewildered. He is currently visiting my court from a far-away land, and we happened to discuss my vegetarian diet. “But... you’re not that skinny!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.20.a;Some of the vegetarian monks are very obese, I assure you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.21.desc;Even though it’s for the good of all sentient beings, I’m starting to get sick of my vegetarian diet. It’s nothing but vegetables, fruits, and other bland things every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.21.a;I feel like a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.22.desc;My cook has to prepare meals not only for me, but everyone in my household and any guests who visit as well. I am aware that because of this, some of the vegetarian meals he prepares for me might be tainted with a bit of meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.22.a;That is something I have to live with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.22.b;I’ll force my cook to take extra precautions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.23.desc;Would I ever passionately kiss someone who just ate meat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.23.a;I wouldn’t kiss anyone at all to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.23.b;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.23.c;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.23.d;Only if they are really attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.24.desc;While arguing with one of my courtiers about the merits of vegetarianism, my courtier tells me, “People will still continue to kill animals no matter what. Animals will still be butchered and eaten by thousands and millions of people. By refraining from meat, you’re only saving a few animals at most.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.24.a;Hmm… a good point. Would saving a few animals do anything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vegetarian.24.b;Even if I only save a few animals, that’s better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

retreat_master_desc;This character has participated in several meditation retreats, and has gained a great amount of spiritual insight as a result. This character has almost certainly gained a lot of good merit, and will likely be reborn in a fortunate realm in his or her next life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.1.desc;Even if I am a well-off [Root.GetTitle] who has everything in the world, I feel like I am still lacking, spiritually. I’ve decided to thus go to one of the major temples in the region, and participate in a spiritual retreat for an extended period of time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.1.a;It will be difficult to forget my worldly concerns for a while, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.1.b;I look forward to returning to the temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.tooltip;First, some preparations must be made while I am away. I must make sure everything at my court is in order, since I’ll be gone for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.name;Coming to the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.desc;The journey to the temple was more strenuous than I expected, but we have arrived nonetheless. I engage in the normal formalities upon reaching the temple - prostrating before Lord Buddha, bestowing gifts upon the monks, and so on. Eventually, I remove all my luxurious clothing and put on the humble robes of an ascetic.\n\nAs night comes, I am shown to my dormitory where I will be sleeping during my stay. It’s a change from the luxurious palace rooms, but I’ll get used to it. After all, I’ll be staying for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.a;Three months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.b;Half a year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.2.c;One year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.3.tooltip;Tomorrow, the retreat will begin - I can’t wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.3.desc;My retreat has begun. It will be difficult getting used to only two sparse meals a day and the constant meditation sessions. Under the guidance of the temple’s retreat masters, I hope to cultivate my mind towards compassion and mindfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.3.a;I will dedicate any merit gained to all sentient beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.4.tooltip;Tomorrow, the retreat will begin - it’s good to be back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.4.desc;My retreat has begun. Although it’s been a while since I’ve lived such a spartan lifestyle, I’ve done it before, and I have no trouble adjusting back to it. Under the guidance of the temple’s retreat masters, I am reviewing several meditation techniques and learning a few new ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.4.a;During this retreat, I will try to focus on improving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.5.desc;It’s been three months since I begun my retreat. I think I’ve gotten used to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.5.a;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.6.desc;It’s been half a year since I begun my retreat. So far, I have gained much spiritual insight… I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.6.a;I only have half a year to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.7.desc;It’s been nine months since I begun my retreat. Time passes by so quickly when one is engaged in spiritual practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.7.a;Only three more months to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.8.desc;The retreat is about to end in a few days, and I will thus have to leave the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.8.a;I should get ready to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.8.b;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.8.c;Hmm. Is there any difference between the temple and palace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.9.name;The Retreat Ends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.9.desc;My spiritual retreat has ended. I feel strange, even frightened, leaving the temple and readjusting to normal life. The retreat was a strange, uncomfortable experience, after all, and I still think of it as rather difficult, yet I learned much.\n\nCompassion. Mindfulness. Patience. Inner peace.\n\nI have been exposed to the Dharma in ways I could not have possibly imagined. Can I possibly put these lessons to practice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.9.a;At the least, I can try meditating a bit each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.10.desc;My spiritual retreat has ended. I feel anxious returning to my normal routine after being away for so long. The monks, too, are sad to see me go. They told me I have learned quite a lot in the short time I’ve been here, and feel I hold much promise, spiritually.\n\nPerhaps I should return one day, and engage in another retreat. Until then, I can try to apply the lessons I’ve learned to my daily life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.10.a;For instance, I can meditate a bit each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.11.desc;My spiritual retreat has ended. Adjusting from the temple life to my daily routine as a [Root.GetTitle] isn’t as difficult as it used to be - my diligent efforts in studying and practicing the Dharma have equipped me with the tools needed to handle the toils and problems of normal life.\n\nRegardless, the monks say I have become quite realized myself, possessing a level of awareness uncommon even among most monks. I now understand that the troubles I encounter in this lifetime are the result of my karmic actions in previous lifetimes, and I am glad that I had enough good karma to be able to participate in this spiritual retreats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.11.a;I will return. There is much I can still learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.12.desc;My spiritual retreat has ended. Adjusting from the temple life to my daily routine as a [Root.GetTitle] isn’t as difficult as it used to be - my diligent efforts in studying and practicing the Dharma have equipped me with the tools needed to handle the toils and problems of normal life.\n\nRegardless, the monks say I have become quite realized myself, possessing a level of awareness uncommon even among most monks. I now understand that the troubles I encounter in this lifetime are the result of my karmic actions in previous lifetimes, and I am glad that I had enough good karma to be able to participate in this spiritual retreats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.12.a;I will return. There is much I can still learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.13.desc;My spiritual retreat has ended. Before, returning to daily life would’ve felt strange, jarring, even frightening. But I now know that there is no true difference between the temple and the palace. A true master can practice the Dharma anywhere, at any time.\n\nSome meditate while they eat, or walk. Some meditate as they make craftwork or practice archery. And, so too, will I meditate - focus and concentrate, stay mindful - in every moment, every breath, every moment while I work off my karmic debt in this life as a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.13.a;I will attain enlightenment, for all sentient beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.14.desc;Today’s meditation sessions are going well enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.14.a;Breathe in… and out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.15.desc;Sitting in meditation today, I feel much calmer than usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.15.a;Everything feels so relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.16.desc;I join the monks in chanting the names of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.16.a;This should improve my ability to concentrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.17.desc;As I walk towards the meditation hall, I notice many insects crawling about. I must be careful not to step on them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.17.a;In this holy place, killing - even if accidental - is not permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.18.desc;I suddenly have an itch while I’m meditating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.18.a;Try to ignore it and resume meditating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.18.b;Scratch it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.19.desc;My current meditation session hasn’t ended yet, but my legs are getting numb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.19.a;Ouch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.19.b;I adjust my legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.20.desc;I ask one of the senior monks, "What is Buddha?"\n\nHe replies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.20.a;"Three pounds of flax.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.20.b;"That tree over there.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.20.c;"A dried stick of manure.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.20.d;… by hitting me on the head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.21.name;An Exam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.21.desc;As usual, some of the monks and retreat participants are engaging in spiritual discussion and debate, and I decide to observe. Suddenly, a senior monk of great age brings forth a chair and sets it before everyone. “Can anyone prove that this chair’s true essence is that of emptiness, prove that it is an illusion in our mind?” he asks.\n\nThe others eagerly begin making their cases, citing the sutras or referencing ideas about the mindstream and dependent origination, saying the chair is like this and that. However, none of their answers satisfies the old monk. Finally, one monk - who had been silent for some time - speaks up, and asks, “What chair are we arguing about?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.21.a;I see the old monk smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.22.name;The Nature of Emptiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.22.desc;I am participating in a philosophical discussion with one of the senior monks to prove how much of the Dharma I’ve learned. I proclaim, “The true nature of everything is emptiness. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not exist. There is no realization, no delusion, no sage. There is no giving and nothing to be received.”\n\nThe senior monk is silent, his face unmoving. Is he thinking? Suddenly - WHACK - he hits me on the head. I am angered, but the monk patiently asks me:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.22.a;“If nothing exists, where did that anger come from?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.23.name;To Know and Not Know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.23.desc;There is a kind and patient senior monk at the temple who has always provided me with good advice and insight. After a meditation session, I ask him, “What happens to an enlightened man after death?”\nHe replies, “I don’t know.”\nI subsequently ask, “But aren’t you a master?”\n”Yes,” he says, “But not a dead one.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.23.a;Oh! The future is unforseeable. I must focus on the present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.23.b;Ah. A wise man knows that he knows nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.24.name;Lotus Position;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.24.desc;Many people, while doing sitting meditation, sit in the so-called half-lotus position, where only one foot is placed on the opposing thigh. Some more flexible individuals, though, can do the so-called full lotus position, where two feet are placed on the opposing thigh. However, few can learn this position without lots of practice.\n\nI myself, after a lot of practice, have managed to master the full lotus position without too much hassle. This should help me improve my meditation, as the monks say it naturally increases one’s concentration and mental ability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.24.a;Let’s do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.25.desc;My attempts at more complicated meditation techniques have failed these past couple of days. Thus, I’ve decided that while meditating today, I’ll practice one of the most basic meditation techniques - trying to focus only on my breathing, and the sensation of my breath going in and out of my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.25.a;In… out… in… out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.26.desc;During these meditation retreats, we’re not supposed to eat a lot - just enough to sustain ourselves. That said, since I am a [This.GetTitle], I could easily get away with taking more food than I am normally given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.26.a;I definitely need more food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.26.b;I will take just a little more food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.26.c;No, I must practice self-control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.26.d;I will fast for a few days if that’s what it takes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.27.desc;I’m attempting to meditate with my eyes half-open, as some of the monks have recommended. Still, it’s distracting - I’m trying to clear my mind of useless thoughts, yet with my eyes half-open, I can still see some of things happening around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.27.a;Better try it with my eyes shut for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.28.desc;A method of meditation taught by the masters is so-called visualization meditation, where one focuses on a specific Buddha or Bodhisattva. Aptitude with this form of meditation will greatly increase one’s chances of being born in a Buddha realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.28.a;I visualize Buddha Amitabha with all the concentration I can muster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.29.desc;The robes I must wear during the meditation retreat are rather uncomfortable. I am not used to wearing these sorts of things everyday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.29.a;However, I must wear them so I can concentrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.30.desc;When today’s last meditation session ended, my legs were so numb I couldn’t walk. However, one of the monks noticed my trouble, and he showed me some techniques to relieve my legs of numbness I was previously unaware of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.30.a;What a kind man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.31.desc;The monks instruct me that meditation is a method for gaining inner peace, as well as a way to see the world more clearly. If I am calm and thoughtful, I’ll be wiser in my decisions and more virtuous in my conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.31.a;I must have a lot of self-control and patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.31.b;Bah, why is this self-control and patience so difficult?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.32.desc;Sitting still is so difficult! How do these monks manage it? My buttocks are in pain, I am constantly falling asleep... it is so difficult to concentrate while meditating. I could just pretend to be meditating while thinking about other things - that would be much easier, but then that would defeat the purpose of meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.32.a;I take a deep breath, then redouble my efforts to concentrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.32.b;My mind starts wandering to pleasurable thoughts…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.33.desc;Pleasurable fantasies overtake my mind while I’m supposed to be meditation. Delicious wines… scrumptious foods, sweet, salty, spicy… and the most beautiful women, with luscious curves and - WHACK! Suddenly, one of the higher-ranked monks patrolling the meditation room birches one of the novice monks who was falling asleep. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.33.a;Back to meditating! Breathe in, breath out…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
didnt_get_caught_not_meditating;Good thing I didn’t get caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.34.desc;Usually during retreats, participants sleep very little - a few hours a night, in fact. Yet, I’ve never felt more energized. The senior monks say that if one meditates well, one can reduce the need to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.34.a;Amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.35.desc;I think I fell asleep while meditating today. Thankfully no one noticed… right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.35.a;Nervously I try to regain my composure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.36.name;Live in the Moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.36.desc;When retreat participants aren’t meditating, praying, or engaging in some sort of spiritual practice, they also engage in philosophical and spiritual debates and discussions. It’s amazing seeing so many learned and wise monastics gathered together!\n\nIn my eagerness I approach one of the renowned, local monks, an old man known for his deep knowledge of the Dharma. I ask him, “Master, I am very eager to learn about the Dharma, and I would like to hear your opinion - what is enlightenment to you?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.36.a;The master replies: "When hungry, eat. When tired, sleep.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.37.desc;During my retreat, I’ve noticed that one the old monks always goes outside and help the other monks tend the garden that provides most of the food we eat during the retreat. “Why do you work like this, despite being so old?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.37.a;“No work, no food,” he replies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.38.desc;As my ability to concentrate is not highly developed, the monks have suggested that I continuously (but quietly) chant a mantra or a similar prayer, and focus all my energy on that. That way, I can train my mind to concentrate on one single thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.38.a;Namo Amitabhaya…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.39.name;Going Outside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.39.desc;I’ve decided to meditate outside today, rather than inside. Not everyone chooses to meditate this way, preferring the comforts of the inside, but some have said that meditating outside is a very different experience. As I sit down and begin meditating, I can already feel the difference.\n\nNormally, I am so busy with work that I rarely think about what is happening in the world around me. I hear the birds, the insects, the rustling of the trees, the wind as it blows from the heavens above…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.39.a;This is… refreshing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.40.desc;What am I? Am I? Am I not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.40.a;Never mind. Meditating on these questions will distract me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.41.desc;When I begun doing meditation retreats, I used to probe many different spiritual and philosophical questions and provide myself of many different answers. As I have gained more and more insight, I notice I have less and less questions, and less and less answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.41.a;The masters say this is a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.42.desc;As I eat my vegetarian meal for breakfast, I concentrate on the moment. The food. The texture. The smells. The sensation of my mouth moving up and down, chewing. My hands guiding the food into my mouth. Every inch of my body as it prepares to receive the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.42.a;One must meditate in everything one does!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mu_zen;"Mu" (i.e., emptiness);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.43.desc;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.43.a;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.43.b; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.44.desc;I am meditating outside with several monks. I suddenly notice a small insect crawling under the sun, so I pick it up and leave it under the shade of a tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.44.a;I then return to meditate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.45.desc;My efforts in meditation has given me much insight into natural phenomena. With greater concentration and patience, I discern minute details about the world I would have never noticed otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.45.a;I must not, however, get so attached to such abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.46.desc;I fell asleep while meditating today. However, I am neither bothered nor not bothered by my lack of diligence, making sure not to pass unnecessary judgement on my mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.46.a;I quietly resume meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meditation.47.desc;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
