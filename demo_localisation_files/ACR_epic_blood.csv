EVTOPTBancrel.3000;No point in chasing the impossible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.3001;The greatest heroes were those who took part in the Trojan War. Admirable qualities could be found on both sides of that terrible war, but still you must decide, from which side will your heroic muse come?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBancrel.3001;The Trojans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.3002;Of the epic heroes who sided with the Greeks, there were three who stood out as exemplars, which shall you choose to emulate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.3002;I shall endeavour to be like the mighty Achilles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCancrel.3002;The honeyed words of Nestor shall guide my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.3010;One of your favored courtesans has been saying flattering, if a bit indiscrete, things about your skills in the bedroom. Comparisons to such legendary love makers as Paris and Helen have been made, and these rumors are beginning to spread beyond the palace and local brothels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.3010;I am pretty great, aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBancrel.3010;We cannot allow these rumors to continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.3011;Although your role in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s death has been revealed, admiration toward you for the sheer brilliance of the scheme is growing quickly throughout the realm. Spymasters from nearby kingdoms work feverishly to uncover what they are sure to be many plots in their masters realms that you have orchestrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.3013;In the final battle to take the enemy town you found yourself overwhelmed with the thrill of combat and charged headlong into the enemy ranks. Before long you were surrounded, far from your personal guard. But this did not deter you. Instead, you single-handedly cut down thirty men. But, if you were to listen to the rumors that have been circulating through [From.GetBaseName] it was more like 300! Some say that you were the image of Achilles himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.3013;All I can remember is the exhileration...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
