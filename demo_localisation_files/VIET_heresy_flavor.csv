dulcinian_desc;The Dulcinian movement was a religious sect of the Late Middle Ages, originating within the Apostolic Brethren. The Dulcinians, or Dulcinites, and Apostolics were inspired by Franciscan ideals and influenced by the Joachimites, but were considered heretical by the Catholic Church. They espoused the end of feudalism, redistribution and sharing of wealth and power, and an egalitarian society. They were also notorious for their raids and plundering, and senseless slaughter of innocents, justified in their view because they the believers were pure and those who accepted the Church were corrupt beyond salvation.\n\nIn game, the Dulcinians can raid, have female temple holders, and a pope. They also have access to a special CB usable on "corrupt" Christians, but cannot go above low crown authority. Additionally, Dulcinian rulers who hoard gold or have low crown authority will suffer massive malus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.10000.name;The Fraticelli Factions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.10000.desc;The Fraticelli faithful are divided into two camps when it comes to the issues of poverty and humility among the clergy and devout. Some, calling themselves the Relaxati, or Conventuals, believe in moderation and in living in settled areas to help the poor - extreme poverty can only go so far, otherwise, how can the Fraticelli way spread? Others, calling themselves the Zelanti, or Spirituals, take a hardline approach, arguing that strict vows of poverty and a solitary, spartan lifestyle are needed for the survival of the faith. While the two groups don't necessarily hate each other, their differing views do put them at odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
