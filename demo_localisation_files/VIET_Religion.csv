Though some Hindus argue that these Warriors of Shiva are betraying their own beliefs, the new order sees no contradiction, and will protect their faith to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.331.desc;The Ibadi sect of Islam has always been under threat from the more powerful Sunnis and Shiites. Because of this, the Ibadi had to find refuge in defensible locations, such as the harsh mountains of the Maghreb.

As the Mozabite tribe grows in power and size, some of them have banded to form a trans-regional holy order! With the Ibadi sect spreading across the world, it may face threats not only from Sunni and Shiite rulers, but those of other faiths as well, so the rise of the Mozabites could not have come at a more opportune time for the Ibadi faithful. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
