VIETmisc.2000.desc;One of my courtiers came back today after visiting a cousin living in a town some distance away. I was offered some precious onions as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2000.a;Thank you! These would go great in soup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2001.desc;I met an interesting, perhaps slightly crazy traveler today. He claims to have seen red and yellow carrots in a faraway land! Ha ha! What a good joke. Everyone can see carrots are purple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2001.a;What next, orange carrots?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2002.desc;One of your courtiers has lately refused to eat anything with cabbage. When questioned why, you were told: "Cabbage? Oh dear... you know it is peasant's food - it is like water to them. Why would a person of high status such as myself consume such a lowly, filthy plant?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2002.a;A good point!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2002.b;What an extreme attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2003.desc;As I get older, I'm starting to lose some hair. My doctor prescribed onions as a way to combat this problem. The medicinal properties of onion, he said, would help me on this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2003.a;My breath will smell really bad after this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2004.desc;Rumors abound that several demons or evil spirits of some sort have recently habituated themselves near my residence. I have seen the commoners living nearby start to hang garlic on their windows in order to protect themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2004.a;I should do the same to protect myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2004.b;Those gullible, superstitious fools...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2005.desc;I gaze hungrily at the large pile of fufu sitting before me and my courtiers, as we prepare ourselves for a traditional [Root.Culture.GetName] meal. Then, as the highest ranked person present, I am the first to pinch the dough-like fufu, made from yam, off my right fingers and roll it into a ball. I then drop it into my soup, and begin eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2005.a;Enjoy, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2006.desc;I'm in the mood for some salad. They say it reminds one of the peaceful Greek countryside, and I feel like I need to relax after a stressful day of business. What better than a refreshing mix of fresh vegetables and mouthwatering cheese and dressing?;;;;;;;;;;;
VIETmisc.2007.desc;I drank some water and choked on it. Thankfully a servant saved me, but my court witnessed the entire embarrassing situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2007.a;A frightening experience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2008.desc;After a stressful day, drinking some fresh, cool water is so relaxing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2008.a;Aaaahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2009.desc;The wells used by your court for water have dried up. It is time to dig up new ones, and soon, or else everyone at the court will die of thirst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2009.a;Send the men to find a new well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3000.desc;Blindness is an unimaginable inconvenience, but after years of suffering, I've noticed my other senses getting better and better. I notice and perceive things others don't, and surprisingly it even gives me an advantage over others..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3000.a;They're compensating for my lack of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
