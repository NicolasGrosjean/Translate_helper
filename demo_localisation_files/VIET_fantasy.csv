fantasia.0.desc;Lately, everyone has noticed a lovely young maiden who occasionally comes to attend Church services at the church I go to. But what strikes everybody as amazing is her voice - it is beautiful beyond imagination! Why she is here, and who she is, no one knows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.0.a;But she doesn't harm anyone, so we accept her presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.1.tooltip;I am fascinated by her...;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.2.title;A Mysterious Disappearance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.2.desc;Where has [From.GetTitledFirstName] gone? No one knows what happened to that youth.\n\nI was in fact the last person to see him. He was there, by the sea, singing beautifully with that mysterious maiden with the lovely voice. They began walking towards the waters, but at that point I figured they may have wanted some privacy, so I left them alone.\n\nMaybe they were lovers, and eloped somewhere?;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.2.a;Who knows. But I have business to attend to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.3.tooltip;Everyone slowly forgets about [From.GetTitledFirstName]. For all we know, he is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.3.title;Siren?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.3.desc;Early in the morning, though I'm feeling sleepy, I want to escape the confines of my residence and get some fresh air. I travel to the edge of the sea, to feel the fresh ocean breeze and see the pure waters.\n\nFor my amusement, I walk into the waves getting my feet wet (no matter, my servants will clean me afterwards), and hurl some stones into the ocean, as far as I can, to see how strong I am. I pause, however, as I hear a young woman's voice.\n\nI turn around, and to my shock, I see that very same maiden with the beautiful singing voice, the one I thought eloped away, sitting on one of the nearby rocks. But this time, there's something different about her. I glance down, and to my horror I realize she has no feet, but fish scales.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.3.a;"Stop that stone-throwing" the mermaid says, smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.4.tooltip;I'm too shocked to say anything, much less apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.4.title;A Voice Like No Other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.4.desc;The mermaid explains, "You must understand one of the windows to our house is down there, and your stones were causing quite a racket!"\n\n"I... I... I... apologize!" I stutter. "But you... but wait, I thought you and him... we all thought... something happened to both of you?"\n\nShe smiles and says in a sing-song voice, "Worry not about him, he is happy where he is. We are married, and in love now. But... I am rude, to be so brash in the presence of a [Root.GetTitle]. Shall I sing you a song?";;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.4.a;Very well...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.4.b;Yes, yes please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.5.tooltip;I'm starting to feel... sleepy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.5.title;Waking Up By The Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.5.desc;My servants woke me. Apparently everyone had been searching for me, and I fell asleep on the beach. "Did you see her, that... that creature?" I asked my servants. They shook their heads, confused.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.5.a;Maybe I just fell asleep on the beach and had a strange dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.6.tooltip;I can sit here all day and listen to her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.6.title;Under the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.6.desc;The mermaid sings, smiling at me as she plays with her hair. She begins to move towards the sea - but how does she without legs? But does it matter? Her voice is lovely beyond reason.\n\nAnd I, too, begin to walk towards the sea. "Sire," she says, briefly interrupting our song, "I have a friend, maybe two or more, who would be delighted to meet you."\n\nShe then continues singing, but I know she expects an answer from me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.6.a;Yes, I will go into the sea with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_mermaid_death_lol;...and enjoy the sweetest music men's ears have every heard, for all eternity! (You die... or so the official records will say.);;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.6.b;No, I cannot, I have my duties to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.5.tooltip2;She nods, and continues singing. Now, however, I'm starting to feel very sleepy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.7.title;The Mermaid of [Root.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.7.desc;Many years ago, the local ruler of this province was said to have been lured to the sea by mermaids, where he now lives in paradise for all eternity. The mermaid, nevertheless, is said to be a benevolent one, that watches over the locals for the sake of this lord.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.7.a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merlin_visions_evil;These visions are nothing but evil, I think. My prayers will give me strength to avoid their temptation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
merlin_visions_evil_pagan;These visions are nothing but evil, I think. My prayers will give me strength to avoid their temptation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
merlin_visions_cynical;And why would I stupidly go into that forest just because I wanted to? It’s rather dangerous, anyways - not that I’m a coward, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.8.desc;Near my residence is some old woodland. They say it’s been there since the beginning of time, and holds many mysteries and secrets. People are afraid to go into it, for fear of offending whatever magic or spirits - good or bad - that dwell there. In my dreams, recently, I keep seeing this woodland, and felt its magic and energy that dwells within it calls to me. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.8.a;There is something powerful in it, something I must find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.8.b;[Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is tempting me. I’ll pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to help me ignore these evil visions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.8.c;I sense dark magic in these visions… I must avoid the woods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.8.d;I’m just having silly dreams, they probably don’t mean anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.9.desc;The dreams are still occurring. It’s like something needs me to come into the woods. This is all very strange…;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.9.a;Maybe there’s a reason behind all this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.9.b;I must pray that my spirit be purged of these evil magics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.9.c;People delude themselves with silly dreams all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merlin_visions_evil_2;BEGONE, EVIL MAGIC! BEGONE! BEGONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merlin_visions_cynical_2;But I won’t be one of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.10.tooltip;I must be having these dreams - or visions, perhaps - for some reason, and I want to know why! Maybe the woods want to show me something.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.10.desc;There is something amazing and unexplainable about these woodlands I want to explore. Early in the morning, when everyone is still asleep, I sneak out, into the woods. As day breaks, the sunlight shines through the mighty trees.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.10.a;I see a pathway up ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.11.tooltip;Wonder where it leads...;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.11.desc;As I proceed along the ancient pathway, I come across something - namely, a pile of large rocks, and an old, bearded man awkwardly standing in the middle of them as if he were stuck. "Please, if you are so kind, will you pray on my behalf, for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to assist me with my trouble?";;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.11.a;Alright… I suppose I can pray for you…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.tooltip;I close my eyes for a moment and ask [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to assist this mysterious old man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.title;The Wise Seer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.desc;After I said my prayer, I asked the old man what his problem was. He said he was in love with a beautiful young sorceress, who placed a curse on him. I start to feel pity for this benevolent, wise figure, with his long beard and sagely appearance.\n\nHe smiles, and says, "Anyhow, I am rude as to not introduce myself - know me as the Enchanter. Thank you for freeing me of my chains. I prophesize good things as long as you live and trust in the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]."\n\nWhile he dramatically makes his way out of the pile of rocks, I suddenly feel extremely sleepy. I almost collapse on a nearby tree as I try to sit down and lean on its side. As my eyes begin to close, I hear the old man saying something of like...;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.a;"The once and future king has yet to return, but I think it will be soon.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.b;"You have returned, my once and future king! May heaven grant you fortune.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fantasia.12.c;"The once and future king returned to defend Britain. Good. My work is done.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
where_is_merlin;When I wake up, the old man is nowhere to be found. Oddly, for some reason, I feel like I’ve been imbued with some mysterious power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_mermaid_legend;Legend of the Mermaid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_mermaid_legend_desc;Local folklore says that a long time ago the ruler of this region was lured to the sea by mermaids where he now lives in paradise for all eternity. The benevolent mermaids, as a gesture of goodwill, are said to now watch over this land for his sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
