hit_by_a_meteor;[Root.Location.GetName] is hit by a meteor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.0.desc;I was in the middle of my business when I was interrupted by a deafening sound. I rush to the nearest window, and the next thing I saw was a blinding flash of fiery light.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.0.a;WHAT IN THE NAME OF OBLIVION IS THAT -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.title;A Fiery Ball of Death;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.desc;In all the years of recorded history, there has never been a calamity as terrible as this one. [From.Location.GetName] has been struck by a large, fiery ball of death, a meteor - so large and bright that there are rumors that even the people of Cathay and Nippon witnessed it.\n\nThousands and thousands are dead, entire settlements have been leveled, fires rage across the land, and a massive dark cloud of ash and smoke cover the region. Those unfortunate enough to survive will have to deal with the unrest and anarchy that follow in the wake of such a disaster, but how can anyone rebuild after this?\n\nThere are now some that even say the apocalypse is upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.a;Terrible! May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] bless their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.2.desc;[From.Location.GetName] has been the very target of a large meteor impact. The dead are in the tens if not hundreds of thousands, and the destruction is massive. Even after we deal with the influx of refugees and any clean-up attempts, [From.Location.GetName] will suffer for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.2.a;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
killed_by_meteors;It's certain that many currently in [From.Location.GetName] - some of your courtiers, vassals, family members, and even you yourself - are among the dead or injured.;;;;;;;;;;;x
killed_by_meteors_distant;Although [Root.Location.GetName] wasn't directly hit by the meteor, it did suffer in the aftermath. It's possible that many currently there - some of your courtiers, vassals, family members, and even you yourself - are among the dead or injured.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETdisaster.7.desc;Before anybody has time to react, there is a huge explosion. You awake moments later in the middle of a large field of rubble, corpses, and raging fires. Unfortunately, it seems you have nasty cuts and wounds, and while it hurts, you quickly realize you were lucky to be alive, or, even better, with all your body parts intact.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.7.a;You wander aimlessly, hoping to find any other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.8.desc;Before anybody has time to react, there is a huge explosion. You awake moments later in the middle of a large field of rubble, corpses, and raging fires, feeling great pain. It appears you've been maimed! However, you know in your heart it could've been worse. Thankfully a few other survivors nearby hear your cries and groans, and they help pull you out of the rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.8.a;You all wander aimlessly, hoping to find any other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETdisaster.9.a;AAAGGGHHHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.10.desc;You saw the fiery ball of destruction as it fell. Just as you and your companions try to comprehend what just happened, a large cloud of smoke and ash appear. You all try to run away as it approaches, but to no avail. In the ensuing chaos, you injure yourself, though when the cloud clears you thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] that it was a simple wound, and nothing worse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.10.a;You try to find other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.11.desc;You saw the fiery ball of destruction as it fell. Just as you and your companions try to comprehend what just happened, a large cloud of smoke and ash appear. You all try to run away as it approaches, but to no avail. In the ensuing chaos, you injure yourself badly. As the cloud clears, you realize due to your injuries you can no longer move properly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.11.a;You are helped to your feet by other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.12.desc;You saw the fiery ball of destruction as it fell. Just as you and your companions try to comprehend what just happened, a large cloud of smoke and ash appear. You all try to run away as it approaches, but to no avail. The last thing you see is the grey soot blowing in your face, and the last thing you feel is an indescribably powerful force slamming into your body.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.12.a;AAAGGGHHHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.13.desc;Before anybody has time to react, there is a huge explosion. You awake moments later in the middle of a large field of rubble, corpses, and raging fires. Though you have some minor bruises and cuts, and you are temporarily blinded by all the dust, you emerge relatively unscathed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.13.a;You later find out you were very lucky, perhaps protected by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.14.desc;You saw the fiery ball of destruction as it fell. Just as you and your companions try to comprehend what just happened, a large cloud of smoke and ash appear. You all try to run away as it approaches, but to no avail. Thankfully you were unharmed as the cloud clears - you're just covered in dust and ash - but others weren't so lucky.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.14.a;You just know this is going to be a long day...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_meteor_survivor;Some of the other survivors report witnessing a large ball of fire descend from the heavens onto earth. Could this be the end times?;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETdisaster.20.desc;Flames reaching as high as the sky and large clouds of smoke are coming out of a mountain in [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.20.a;The volcano is erupting!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.21.title;The Volcano in [VIET_volcano_victim.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.21.desc;Terrible news from [VIET_volcano_victim.GetName], as a calamity of unmatched proportions has struck there.\n\nWalls of fire, lava, and ash have descended upon the unfortunate inhabitants of the region as one of the local volcanoes have erupted. Hundreds have died, and though many more have survived, there has been massive destruction to property, crops, and livestock. It is likely that hundreds more, particularly refugees fleeing from the disaster, will die due to starvation and the health effects of this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.21.a;I pray for their souls!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.22.desc;Although [Root.GetName] wasn't directly affected by the volcanic eruption in [VIET_volcano_victim.GetName], the clouds of smoke have nevertheless spread to the area. This will surely affect the crops and livestock in the area and cause famine and other sorts of upheaval.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.22.a;This isn't good news at all!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.23.desc;You can see the volcano from far away, as if hell itself was invading the earth! Thankfully, you manage to flee - though you have suffered some injuries, you manage to arrive in a safe part of [VIET_volcano_victim.GetName], and are glad to be alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.23.a;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.23.b;It is my duty to help others!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_volcano_coward;You flee! Although you are nothing but a coward, your lack of bravery is understandable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_volcano_rescue_others;Like a heroic king of old, you risk your life to protect the very people you rule over!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_volcano_good_hero;Your efforts will not go unappreciated, as you certainly saved many lives today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_volcano_great_hero;There will be no cowardice today, only courage and nobility of heart! If we die, we die as heroes!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_volcano_hero_flee;You turn around and run for your life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.24.desc;You saw the volcano erupt with your own eyes, as if hell itself was invading the earth! Thankfully, you manage to flee - though the journey was perilous, and you almost got caught in a cloud of ash at one point, you manage to arrive in a safe part of [VIET_volcano_victim.GetName] without any serious injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.24.a;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.25.desc;You can see the volcano from far away, as if hell itself was invading the earth! Unfortunately, in the midst of the chaos, you were too slow, and the cloud of smoke and ash caught up with you - your eyes are blinded and you start choking as you suffocate to death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.25.a;NOOOOO -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.26.desc;You and a group of volunteers make your way into the local settlements, warning people of the calamity, pointing out the best place to flee, helping those such as the elderly and disabled make their way to safety. Unfortunately, there is only so much you can do. It's only a matter of time now before the clouds of smoke and ash catch up with you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.26.a;Alright, let us go now! We've done all we can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.26.b;No! There are still others to be rescued!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.27.desc;You and a few courageous men brave continue making your way around the area, saving as many lives as you can. But alas, the cloud of smoke and ash is about to descend upon you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.27.a;Run for it! Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.28.desc;By some sort of miracle, even though the cloud of ash and smoke was just about to devour you and your companions, you all somehow managed to run away from it. Maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], seeing your heroic, noble deeds, blessed you with speed, or slowed down the incoming cloud.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.28.a;We're alive! We're alive!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.29.desc;Too late! Before you know it, you start suffocating and your organs start failing. However, you are glad that you were able to save a few people - surely your sacrifice was not in vain, and you shall live on in the hearts and minds of those you rescued!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.29.a;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows I die with no regrets!;;;;;;;;;;;x
