VIETceltic.0.desc;Britain is ours again! Though some have doubted it possible, you have proven them wrong. Through strength of arms and cunning acumen, we have rid much if not all of old Britain of our enemies.\n\nSomeday, bards will compose songs in your honor, singing of your great deeds - for you are a leader unlike any other, one who is in the likeness of the heroic King Arthur of old. No wonder, then, that many are claiming you to be a second King Arthur, or even that you are him yourself. Britain is once again ruled by the Britons, and you shall be the first king under a new, united Kingdom of Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.0.a;ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.1.desc;Centuries ago the Britons were driven from the fertile grasslands and forests of Britain by marauding Anglo-Saxon invaders to dwell on the fringes of civilization, in Wales, Cornwall, and Britanny. They watched as their ancestral homeland was torn asunder by violence and chaos.\n\nBut no more. A powerful ruler by the name of [From.GetFirstName] has reunified much of old Britain, driving out the foreign invaders, and has formed the Kingdom of Britain. Many see in this uniting hero the spirit of King Arthur, the chivalrous and heroic monarch of British legend. A new Camelot has thus appeared, but can it last the test of time, or will it fall to war and anarchy once again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.1.a;Today a new Avalon rises from the ashes of war and destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.2.desc;After some traveling, you make your way to the famous holy well in your realm. Wading your way through the masses of pilgrims, clergymen, and locals, you finally come to the well itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.2.a;Offer prayers to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.3.desc;Many admire you as a leader. Were you and your dynasty not the ones who reunified Britain and drove out its invaders after centuries of hopelessness and despair? Comparing you to King Arthur is not only apt, it is perfect - both, great monarchs and defenders of Britain. To solidify your legitimacy, it may be a good idea to enforce these Arthurian ideals. For instance, perhaps that most esteemed chivalric order, the Knights of the Round Table, could be re-established. Having a loyal group of peerless knights by your side would earn you much prestige and the respect of men across the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.3.a;Knights, arise! The old order is reborn anew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPERATION_ORANGE_KUN_COMMENCE;ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.4.desc;[Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has appointed me as a Knight of the Round Table. This is quite an honor! I can now count myself among the ranks of legendary figures such as Lancelot,  Galahad, and Tristan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.4.a;Our enemies shall taste my storm of loyalty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.4.b;An interesting development for sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.5.desc;Due to various circumstances, I can no longer be a Knight of the Round Table. It was great while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.5.a;And now, for something completely different...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.1.title;Britain Reclaimed by the Britons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.0.title;All Hail BRITANNIA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.3.title;Knights of the Round Table;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.6.desc;Victory is ours! How many generations of Cornish men and women fought for this moment, we do not know. But what we do know is that we are now truly the masters of our old lands, Dumnonia, and you her first monarch in many centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.6.a;Our struggle isn't over until all Britain is freed of foreign yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.7.title;Dumnonia Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.7.desc;Against great odds, the Cornish people have prevailed, and now control much of their ancestral lands under the Kingdom of Dumnonia once more. Though they are but a small part of the British isles, this victory could be just the beginning of greater things. Could Dumnonia reunite the Britons and reclaim the entire island?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.7.a;Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.8.title;The Stannary Charters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.8.desc;Under pressure from the tin miners of Cornwall, I have decided to grant the miners of [Root.GetName] special privileges such as a monopoly on tin mining in the province and allowing them their own courts and legal institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.8.a;The area will prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.9.title;The Stannary Charters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.9.desc;After some deliberation, I have decided to revoke the special privileges previously granted to the tin miners of [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.9.a;Hopefully the inhabitants aren't too angry about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.10.title;Another King Arthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.10.desc;Tales of your heroism have spread throughout Britain and beyond. Many consider you an equal to the first and second King Arthurs, as these uniters are called. To your admirers, you are not only a great leader, but also a heroic champion and a virtuous saint. Bards will sing of your greatness centuries from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.10.a;ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.10.b;A Queen Arthur, ha ha! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.11.title;Hogback Stones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.11.desc;My father has just passed away. Since he was an important noble, his burial site will be decorated with special tombstones in the [Root.Culture.GetName] tradition, which some call "Govan" or "Hogback" stones - large, intricately carved stones displaying the artistic heritage of the Norse and, more chiefly, Britons. It's important I work with other relatives to contribute financial resources to ensure these stones are finished promptly and with adequate quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.11.a;If I delay for too long, it will reflect badly on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hogback_stones_instructions;You have about one year to officially contribute to your father's hogback stone. Succeed and gain the respect of your relatives - fail and earn their distrust and scorn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
contribute_to_fathers_hogback_stone;Contribute to Father's Hogback Stone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
contribute_to_fathers_hogback_stone_desc;Contribute financially to your father's hogback stone - remember you don't have much time left before your relatives look upon you with scorn for failing to honor even your own father!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.12.title;Disappointing Child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.12.desc;My failure to contribute financially to the building of my father's hogback stone is a stain on my honor and reputation. I have disappointed my family. I have disappointed my father. Some say I don't even deserve my position anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.12.a;Hopefully I'll survive this stain on my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.13.desc;Amazing news from [Root.GetName]! A most holy well was discovered there, possessing much spiritual power and capable of performing miracles. Some have claimed they were even healed of various ailments by its great powers. Many people - rich and poor, near and far - are traveling to this location because of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.13.a;Perhaps I should visit this well sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.14.desc;The holy well of [Root.GetName] isn't as popular as it once was. A good number of the faithful still claim that it has much spiritual power, but fewer and fewer people are coming to visit it - there are other holy wells, more famous ones, it seems. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.14.a;What pity that it is now fading into obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.15.desc;Dulcinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.15.a;Dulcinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.20.title;Paying for the Hogback Stones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.20.desc;After meeting with the right people and making the right connections, I believe I have the resources necessary to provide my father with an excellent hogback stone that will sit upon his tomb. He shall be honored greatly, and all will know of the duty I bear to my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.20.a;I will contribute as much as I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.20.b;I will contribute a decent amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.20.c;I can only contribute a bit, but I'll contribute nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.21.tooltip;You wait until the stone is finished, and only then will you be able to properly honor your father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.21.title;Honoring Father;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.21.desc;You watch as the hogback stone is placed upon your father's grave.\n\nYou gaze, face still, face motionless, on your father's final resting place.\n\nYour father. A man you knew quite a bit about, yet there is still much you wished you could have discussed with him. He lived his life, and you will continue to live yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.21.a;Life moves on, whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.23.desc;Though nominally conquered by the Romans, the Celtiberian peoples have survived in isolated parts of the mountainous regions of northern Iberia. Today, some of them have come to your court, offering their military services. As the Celtiberians descend from a long line of skilled and fearsome warriors, they may prove very useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.23.a;Good! Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tro Breizh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.100.title;Tro Breizh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.100.desc;They say that any Breton who doesn't finish the Tro Breizh pilgrimage will suffer in the afterlife, having to complete it then. It is about time I did this pilgrimage! While it is not as prestigious nor rigorous as traveling to Jerusalem, for instance, it is an important part of our heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.100.a;I will make the necessary preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.101.tooltip;A chance to renew myself spiritually, and see all the wonderful sights in our lovely land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.101.title;Touring Brittany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.101.desc;The day has come. It is time to begin the Tro Breizh pilgrimage! I will thus travel to the seven towns of the founding saints of Brittany and gain much piety in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.101.a;First is Quimper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.102.tooltip;Let us visit the town of Saint Corentin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.102.title;Quimper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.102.desc;The rustic town of Quimper isn't as elegant nor extravagant as I would've wished, but it certainly has a certain charm. The conservative folk here are very spiritual, and the religious atmosphere is a good start to my pilgrimage.\n\nI make way to the church of Saint Corentin to pray and reflect. He was the first bishop of this town, and it is said that he had a miraculous fish whose parts would regrow, thus allowing him to sustain himself for as long as he needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.102.a;That makes me hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.103.tooltip;But first I must pray first before I leave Quimpur, for tomorrow I head for Saint-Pol-de-Léon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.103.title;Saint-Pol-de-Léon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.103.desc;Saint-Pol-de-Léon is a lovely seaside town blessed with picturesque beaches and the refreshing ocean air. There are an unusual amount of vegetables and fruits being so, which is unsurprising giving the stories surrounding Saint Paul Aurelian, the great saint of this town.\nIt is here where Saint Paul Aurelian established an important monastery. He had an interesting habit of refusing to eat meat, and is said to have lived to almost a century and a half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.103.a;To live that long and be able to do so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.104.tooltip;Our next stop is Tréguier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.104.title;Tréguier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.104.desc;Tréguier is a seaside town like Saint-Pol-de-Léon but it is much busier. An important local port, it is often busy with commerce and trade. Perhaps not always the best fit for a more contemplative, religious experience, but who am I to say that?\n\nTréguier is the town of Saint Tudwal, a renowned hermit and monastic, who was later made bishop of this town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.104.a;I must show his patience, as I wade through the throngs of pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.105.tooltip;After this, we will go to Saint-Brieuc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.105.title;Saint-Brieuc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.105.desc;Now I am at Saint-Brieuc, yet another harbor town. I am a bit tired of the busy towns I've recently come, and thankfully Saint-Brieuc offers refuge in its natural bay, a large reserve of green scenery against the blue waters below. As the locals told me, I can even see and hear hundreds and thousands of birds here, flourishing in this holy site.\n\nHere is also the town of the great Saint Brioc, who founded the monastery that this town revolves around. I am lucky to be in the oratory he established, where it can lend myself to quiet prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.105.a;A holy place indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.106.tooltip;My next destination is Saint-Malo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.106.title;Saint-Malo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.106.desc;I was a bit apprehensive about going to Saint-Malo at first. It is known as a rough neighborhood, where dwell pirates, rowdy seamen, and fearsome adventurers. But I realize this is only one part of the town - there are also normal people who live here, with good Christian virtue, despite (or maybe because of) their surroundings.\n\nSaint-Malo's patron, Saint Malo, perhaps fits this town to some extent. A disciple of Saint Brendan (so I am told), he was said to have traveled and adventured the high seas with his master, reaching a mysterious land called the Blessed Isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.106.a;I wonder what heathens he converted on those isles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.107.tooltip;Once we are done here, onwards to Dol!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.107.title;Dol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.107.desc;Dol is a place filled with history. I heard it was here, for instance, that Saint Teilo was assigned by King Budric to slay a fearsome dragon that had terrorized the locals. How I wish I were there to see that battle! It must have been quite a spectacle, holy saint against evil dragon.\n\nIt was also here that Saint Teilo and Saint Dol planted the fruit groves that remain to this day. As I stroll under these trees, I cannot but help feel at ease in the midst of nature, God's creation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.107.a;Not to mention the fruit they bear is delicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.108.tooltip;Our journey is almost over - one last stop, in Vannes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.108.title;Vannes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.108.desc;I am almost finished with the Tro Breizh, for I now arrive in Vannes, the seventh and last stop on this pilgrimage. It is, despite being a very ancient settlement - dating from before the Roman Emperors, the learned men tell me - very joyous and exciting. I found, for example, much amusement in the comically puffy, ugly granite statues the locals dub "Vannes and his Wife."\n\nBut this is a time for religion, not mirth. I reflect on the saint of Vannes, Saint Patern. He was, in fact, a contemporary of the mighty King Arthur, the great hero, who tamed the king's avarice and humbled the monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.108.a;I too, must practice the virtues. This is why I went on this pilgrimage after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.109.tooltip;My journey is almost over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.109.title;Completing the Tro Breizh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.109.desc;My old residence looms on the horizon. I am home, having finished the Tro Breizh, a duty all Bretons must follow undoubtedly. I have reflected on much through this pilgrimage, and seen the spiritual wonders of our land, our religious heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.109.a;May I remember what I've experienced for as long as live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.150.desc;I long for a quaint, warm festivity, in contrast to the formal, extravagant ones I am used to. This year, I will ensure that our parish's Gwyl Mabsant is even better than the last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.150.a;We will start organizing with local leaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.151.tooltip;This is going to be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.151.desc;The Gwyl Mabsant has begun. Though everyone looks forward to the rowdy, fun activities, we must first attend church. Each locality celebrates Gwyl Mabsant to honor its patron saint, and today is no different. We are serene and reflective as the clergy sing special psalms, and teach us of faith and virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.151.a;But after this, the fun begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.152.tooltip;There will be a lot of things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.152.desc;The fun has begun! There is always so much to see and do at Gwyl Mabsant. I could try to participate in one of the competitions myself, or perhaps watch from afar. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.152.a;Either way, I'm going to have a great time either way,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.153.tooltip;Let's see... what to do first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.153.desc;The cockowners place their cocks on the ground, and set them loose. The audience - myself included - cheers and applauds as the two creatures scratch and bite each other. I'm certainly rooting for that one to win...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.153.a;The stronger looking one. Might makes right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.153.b;The weaker one. I always like seeing good underdog succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.154.desc;Hurrah! My bando team scored a goal. Amazing, how these villagers have trained to use long wooden sticks to strike at goalposts many yards away. It's even more fun to see when bando players hit each other with their sticks - it's almost like jousting, or sparring, except even more intense. No wonder its one of the most popular events at Gwyl Mabsant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.154.a;Haha! Another goal for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.desc;At Gwyl Mabsant, everyone is in mirthful mood. People often drink and sing and dance, and why shouldn't I partake in such festivity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.a;I'm uninterested. This is a holy day, not an opportunity for sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.b;I will drink, and drink 'till I can drink no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.c;Song! There is nothing like that. It lifts the soul yet enlivens the spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.d;Dancing is quite a joy - especially when I get to meet interesting people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.155.e;I don't wish to join in, not that I'm against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wtf_am_i_at_gwyl;Now I have to wonder why I'm here in the first place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.156.desc;At Gwyl Mabsant, one of the more fascinating events are the grinning matches between old women. I don't often see too many elderly peasant women, so it's quite a sight to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.156.a;I'm still not entirely sure on the rules, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.157.desc;Racing wheelbarrows blindfolded! Now this is one of the more exciting events at Gwyl Mabsant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.157.a;I'll partake in the race myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.157.b;I think it's safer to watch - fun, yes, but not the safest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.158.desc;One of the things I look most forward to at Gwyl Mabsant is the hot pudding. Being of high status I always have access to the finest custards and similar sweets, but there's nothing like homemade pudding from the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.158.a;I will indulge in good food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.159.desc;Several days of fun have passed, and the locals are either going home or lying around drunk. This year's Gwyl Mabsant has been wonderful, and I don't think we will see another one like this for years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.159.a;And now I leave this simple, fun world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

go_to_obby_oss_desc;Every year in May, Padstow celebrates the 'Obby 'Oss festival. Maybe this year I should attend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.200.desc;I have decided to visit Padstow this May for the 'Obby 'Oss festival. Regardless of wether I dress up as the Oss, flee from it or simply sit by the sidelines, I can look foward to a fun time and lots of celebration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.200.a;I can't wait for 'Obby 'Oss to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cant_wait_for_obby_oss;You make preparations to travel to Padstow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.201.name;Welcome To Padstow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.201.desc;After some slow and tedious travelling, you and your entourage finally set sight on the small town of Padstow. The town would be like any other in Cornwall, were it not for his (in)famous reputation for hosting the yearly 'Obby 'Oss festival, which attracts not only visitors but also merchants from all around, who come peddle their wares to revellers who are having too much fun to notice the price hike. As you enter the town, the mood is festive and joyous and many people are already tipsy despite it being barely past midday. Many cheers are given to celebrate your arrival as you ride across the gates - 'Long live [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]! Welcome to Padstow your lordship!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.201.a;Yes thank you! Now, when do we start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.202.name;An 'Ossy Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.202.desc;As you approach the town hall you are greeted by the town mayor and the master of ceremonies, who these days is as much an authority as the head of town. They great you with food and refreshment for you and your entourage and inform you that preparations are under way to make these an 'Obby 'Oss to remember. There is only one last question: Would you like to be given the honor of being this year's Old 'Oss, don the 'Oss's costume and chase young maidens all day lol?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.202.a;Chase around... Do you even need to ask?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.202.b;Actually, this year I'll pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.203.name;The 'Ossy Chase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.203.desc;As you approach the town hall you are greeted by the town mayor and the master of ceremonies, who these days is as much an authority as the head of town. They great you with food and refreshment for you and your entourage and inform you that preparations are under way to make these an 'Obby 'Oss to remember. There is only one last question: When the Old 'Oss starts chasing women across town, do you wish to be considered fair game?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.203.a;Of course! Let the 'Oss come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.203.b;I think I'll enjoy it from a distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.204.name;You Are The Old 'Oss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.204.desc;In the early morning, you make your way to the Old 'Oss's 'stable' (The Golden Lion Inn) and with the help of two acolytes don the large mask and huge black cape supported by a frame. You psyche yourself as the stable doors are swung open to a wave of cheers, drums and flutes. While you can't see much with the mask on you can hear many girls challenging you 'Here Ossy! Here Ossy' Accompanied by your hecklers, you set out to grab the women. Every woman you manage to drag under you cape will be blessed and be pregnant within a year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.204.a;Come at me beauties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.205.name;The Old 'Oss Approaches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.205.desc;In the morning, as you descend from your quarters in comfortable white clothes adored with red stripes hanging from your waist, as tradition demands, you come across a lively scene as the townspeople prepare for the Old 'Oss to leave his stable in the inn. To the distress and discomfort of your guards, you merge and mingle with the large group of women when the doors of the inn swing open and the Old Oss emerges from the inside, accompanied from his hecklers. Despite being almost unable to see, the Oss begins chasing the women to the sound of laugher, drums and flutes. Every girl he drags under his large cape is promised to be blessed with child within the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.205.a;Here Ossy! Here Ossy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.206.name;Padstow goes silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.206.desc;As they say, all good things must come to an end. The Old 'Oss is tired and has returned to his stable where it will stay until next year, most of the food and drinks have been consumed and the merchants are starting to pack their wares as the 'Obby 'Oss draws to a close. In the evening, all the townspeople gather by the Maypole to drink and sing songs welcoming the Summer as the countdown to the next 'Obby 'Oss begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.206.a;I can't wait for my next 'Obby 'Ossy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.207.desc;Under the heavy black cape and mask of the Old 'Oss, it's hard to make out who or what is right in front of you, but it is still relatively easy to make out the distinct giggles of a maiden in front of you. When you reach with your arms in front and through the cape, you catch a young peasant girl and proceed to drag her as she lets out a mix of laughter and screaming until only her feet are visible from outside the cape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.207.a;The blessing of the Old 'Oss is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bless_ya_girl;You bless the young girl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.207.b;How about abit of sweetness for the Ossy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steal_a_kiss;You get a kiss! Whooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.207.c;I can make sure the blessing happens later tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obby_ossy_bunga_bunga;You enjoy the Obby Ossy... alot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.208.desc;Under the heavy black cape and mask of the Old 'Oss, it's hard to make out who or what is right in front of you, but it is still relatively easy to make out the distinct giggles of a maiden in front of you. When you reach with your arms in front and through the cape, you catch one of your female courtiers and proceed to drag her inside your cape until only her feet are visible from the outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.208.a;The blessing of the Old 'Oss is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.208.b;How about abit of sweetness for the Ossy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.209.desc;Under the heavy black cape and mask of the Old 'Oss, it's hard to make out who or what is right in front of you, but it is still relatively easy to make out the distinct giggles of a maiden in front of you. When you reach with your arms in front and through the cape, you catch a courtier, someone who you feel some affection for and for whom you believe the feeling is mutual. Under the cape of the 'Oss you are suddenly away from prying eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.209.a;How fortunate that I caught you milady...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.209.b;Oh huh... You're blessed by the Old 'Oss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.210.desc;Being the Old 'Oss is not the easiest job out there. The cape and mask are heavy and black, which traps the heat inside, also visibility is pretty terrible. In an honest mistake you think you hear a maiden in front of you and lunge forward, only to find yourself dragging a young child, who is clearly scared of the Oss's grotesque figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.210.a;Pat the child on the head and send her on her way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.210.b;To little girls, the Ossy brings treats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.211.desc;Being the Old 'Oss is not the easiest job out there. The cape and mask are heavy and black, which traps the heat inside, also visibility is pretty terrible. In an honest mistake you think you hear a maiden in front of you and lunge forward only to find yourself dragging a man under the cape, clearly upset by jeer, while the townsfolk's laughter has grown tenfold with the mixup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.211.a;Scold him for impersonating a woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.211.b;Be festive and laugh it all off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.211.c;Throw him into the horse's water, let the people laugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.2112.desc;Being the Old 'Oss is more than simply chasing girls and follow the parade, as it involves being the center of attention and the embodiment of 'Obby 'Oss fun. As you arrive at the Maypole, right at the center of town, the townspeople start demanding that you dance a jig with one of the damsels..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.2112.a;Good thing I'm in my dancing shoes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.2112.b;Er.... no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.212.desc;There's no way around the fact that the frame of the 'Oss is heavy and cumbersome, but with a nice display of tap dancing, together with some jumping and spinning, you do more than fine. Luckily your dancing partner is helpful and enhances your dance as the revellers clap and ask for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.212.a;I'll need a beer after this, or two...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.213.desc;There's no way around the fact that the frame of the 'Oss is heavy and cumbersome and that certainly affects performance. You try to do some tap dancing and spinning, but unfortunately you trip and fall, having to rely on your dancing partner to get yourself (and the frame) up. You sigh as the cheers have turned to laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.213.a;I'd like to see you all do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.214.desc;While I know there are lots of people around me, inside the Old 'Oss's mask and covered by the cape, it's actually quiet and secluded, and I can talk to the 'Ossy in piece, and it talks to me. It tells me I need to have more fun, more drinks, more of everything, otherwise he'll be sad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.214.a;No 'Ossy, don't be sad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.215.desc;While getting caught is part of the fun, you don't want to make it too easy, so you heckle the 'Oss and clap but retreat if he lunges at you. Finally after some time of this game you aren't fast enough and get grabbed and dragged into the Old 'Oss's cape, where a kind young man helps you on your feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.215.a;Act graciously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.211.b;Make a big fuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.216.desc;While getting caught is part of the fun, you don't want to make it too easy, so you heckle the 'Oss and clap but retreat if he lunges at you. Finally after some time of this game you aren't fast enough and get grabbed and dragged into the Old 'Oss's cape where a young man who clearly had too much to drink already tries to grab you and demands a kiss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.216.a;Overpower him quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.216.b;Coach him into  being more gentle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.216.c;Give him what he wants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.216.d;Make a fuss and kick him into the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.217.desc;Some would say the Old 'Oss is supposed to be the embodiment of fun and hedonism, but even then there are limits. The 'Oss dragged a girl into it cape and while it's impossible to see what's happening inside, the sounds make it clear she's struggling. Some of the townspeople are becoming restless... Maybe it's time to put an end to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.217.a;You! Unhand that girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.217.b;It's all fun and games...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.218.desc;Before the startled eyes of the townspeople you pull up the 'Oss's cape to find a most sordid scene as the young maiden tries to struggle with the man playing the 'Oss attempts to undress her. The townspeople boo as the guards push the man inside a house, strip him of his suit and arrest him. Not before long a new man is playing the 'Oss and many cheers are given to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.218.a;No means no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.219.desc;Before the startled eyes of the townspeople you pull up the 'Oss's cape to find the two innocently flirting until you startle them. The girl rushes outside the cape as the man proceeds in playing the 'Oss. You return to the crowd somewhat embarrassed as you hear whispers around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.219.a;Better safe than sorry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.220.desc;You patiently wait for the girl to get out from under the cape but she tarries. Suddenly her legs start twitching and two men rush to see what's going on, only to find the girl half naked and struggling. A mob quickly surrounds the 'Oss and the mood sours, even after the person playing the part is switched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.220.a;I was just about to intervene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.221.desc;After a minute you and some of the townspeople start feeling nervous about what's happening under the cape, but it all goes well when the girl emerges from under the cape, giggling frantically. What happened no-one can tell, but it the church most likely wouldn't like it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.221.a;I knew nothing bad could happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.222.desc;Some would say the Old 'Oss is supposed to be the embodiment of fun and hedonism, but even then there are limits. The 'Oss dragged a courtier under its cape and while it's impossible to see what's happening inside, the sounds make it clear she's struggling. Some of the townspeople are becoming restless... Maybe it's time to put an end to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.222.a;You! Unhand that girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.222.b;Cheer her on from the outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.223.desc;As the procession arrives at the Maypole, right at the center of town, the townspeople start demanding that the Oss dances a jig with one of the women. Being a guest of honor, the 'Oss is quick to challenge you to a tap dance as the townspeople start applauding and cheering you on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.223.a;I'll shame the 'Oss with my dance moves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.223.b;I... maybe another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.224.desc;Using grace and skill, you impress commoner and noble-born alike with your dance. You dance enthusiastically and energetically as the onlookers cheer you and toast to you, while even the 'Oss struggles to keep up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.224.a;This is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.225.desc;Alas, some people are just not born a dancer, and certainly the drink is not a good enhancement in the struggle to keep balance. You give it your best shot but your clunky moves fail to impress anyone but the drunkards and the 'Oss quickly changes partner in the least offensive way possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.225.a;I can still rule better than all of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.226.desc;You take another sip of your drink and turn to talk to someone when you notice... everyone's gone! A thick mist surrounds Padstow as you struggle to see anything until you notice something in front of you, a rider, with a black cape, on a horse... A BLACK RIDER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.226.a;Sound the alarm! The dark knights come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.227.desc;Everything is dark when you hear your guards call out to you. As you open your eyes you find yourself lying on the floor as many onlookers surround you. You also notice your so called 'black rider', the 'Oss itself. Your guards inform you that you started screaming about black riders before fainting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.227.a;Huh, it seems the black rider fled, good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.228.desc;Here me people of Padstow! This whole celebration is the work of THE DEVIL and pagan gods who seek to corrupt your souls!! We must atone and bun this false idol of a horse that you worship!' One of your religious minded courtiers apparently came to Padstow to do something other than partying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.228.a;Someone shut up that oaf?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.228.b;Maybe next year we can have the Abstinence 'Oss?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.229.desc;You watch the shenanigans of the Old 'Oss parade unfold from a distance when [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] invites you for a dance to the sound of the music being played.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.229.a;Of course! What's a party without dancing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.229.b;Not now! The Old 'Oss just caught someone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.230.desc;With the grace of a sovereign and the energy of a true child of old Britain, you impress your spouse with your skillful dancing ability. Many other noble onlookers also take note of your performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.230.a;We should have a contest where famous nobles can dance and... no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.231.desc;Alas, some people are just not born a dancer, and certainly the drink is not a good enhancement in the struggle to keep balance. You give it your best shot but your clunky moves fail to impress anyone and you stop the dance as people start whispering around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.231.a;I can still rule better than all of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.232.desc;You browse through the merchant's stalls when one of them tries to sell you some squab pie, a local delicacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.232.a;I'll buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.232.b;I'm cornish, of course I know squab pie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.232.c;I don't know... I'll accept a taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.232.d;Squab? Isn't that a pigeon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.233.desc;You are alone at night when you hear a commotion outside. Fearing bandits you immediately fetch the closest weapon and prepare for the whatever may come when you see a tall monster approaching from outside the fence, accompanied by men wielding torches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.233.a;What in heaven's name?...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.234.desc;As the monster comes closer you're put at ease as it's nothing but a crowd of chanters with a Mari Lwyd! As per tradition they start chanting outside your door, in the hope of gaining entrance and receiving food and refreshment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.234.a;Quick! Prepare a small feast to welcome them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.234.b;Give them some food and send them on their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.234.c;They may still be bandits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Knights of Le Round Table, Excalibur, Mordred, etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.500.desc;As tales of my mighty deeds as a Knight of the Round Table spread around the realm and beyond, many are comparing to the greatest Arthurian knight, Sir Lancelot! They say few can match me in valor and chivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.500.a;I feel quite good about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.501.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName]s deeds and reputation as a mighty member of the Knights of the Round Table are known to all Some are making comparisons with the legendary Sir Lancelot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.501.a;I see. May this new Lancelot accomplish great and noble deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.501.b;I am happy for our knight. However, I'd... keep my wife away, though, just in case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.502.desc;Some admire my apparent innocence and sweetness. Being a Knight of the Round Table, a comparison with Sir Perceval is unsurprising. Was there any other knight more innocent than he?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.502.a;So I am like Sir Perceval...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.503.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is gaining a reputation for embodying the personality and attributes of one of the Knights of the Round Table, Sir Perceval. Like Sir Perceval, [From.GetTitledFirstName] often displays an innocent and sweet personality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.503.a;Certainly there is much to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.504.desc;Sir Gawain was one of the mightiest of King Arthurs knights. As a member of the Round Table, people are now drawing comparisons between me and Sir Gawain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.504.a;How flattering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.505.desc;They say [From.GetTitledFirstName] bears a lot of similarities to Sir Gawain. Both, as members of the Round Table, are generally courteous and compassionate, protectors of fair maidens, and are formidable warriors as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.505.a;I see! Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.506.desc;They say I am virtuous and gallant, a pure and noble knight beyond compare. In fact, they say I am like Sir Galahad of old Arthurian legend. I am merely another Knight of the Round Table, and cannot accept such a lofty comparison, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.506.a;But people will think and say what they will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.507.desc;A lot of people are comparing [From.GetTitledFirstName], a member of your Knights of the Round Table, with Sir Galahad, the legendary knight of King Arthur who obtained the Holy Grail and was so virtuous that he ascended straight to heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.507.a;Have I no knight more pure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.508.desc;Last night after the feast I got really drunk, and only vaguely remember sleeping with a beautiful woman. As I reflect on the wonderful experience, I slowly realize to my horror that that woman was no other than my own sister! This is exactly like what happened with King Arthur and his sister Morgause. What have I done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.508.a;We must not speak of this ever again. Never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.508.b;But now that I think about it it wasnt that bad, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_mordred_incest_nay;Heavens forbid she is pregnant with a traitor like Mordred!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_mordred_incest_yay;Lets just hope she wont get pregnant with a traitor like Mordred. In the while, dear sister, Id like to invite you somewhere nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.510.desc;My unholy union with my sibling has resulted in the birth of a son, [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Unfortunately, everyone knows the unusual circumstances of his birth, with some saying the parallels between my new son and the legendary Mordred are alarming. I only hope that he will not grow up to be like that ungrateful traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.510.a;What have I done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.511.desc;My unholy union with my sibling has resulted in the birth of a daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Unfortunately, everyone knows the unusual circumstances of his birth. Though the circumstances of my little girls birth is similar to that of the legendary Mordred, she is, thankfully, a girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.511.a;Hopefully shes just a girl, it cant be that bad, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.512.desc;I dont know why people look at me strangely. Some people say I should be a monster because of my mommy and daddy! Why? I never did anything wrong. Who cares. Ill be smarter, stronger, and better than them one day. Then they wont make fun of me anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.512.a;Thats right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.513.desc;My little [From.GetTitledFirstName] is growing up well despite the unusual circumstances of his birth. They say he is quite a capable boy, who has skills in swordsmanship and horseback riding unmatched among his peers. He also seems to display unnatural intelligence and cunning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.513.a;Thats my boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.513.b;I find this worrying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.514.desc;My little [From.GetTitledFirstName] is growing up well despite the unusual circumstances of her birth. They say she is quite a strong girl, who has learned how to wield sword and master horsemanship, besting many of the boys her age. She also seems to display unnatural intelligence and cunning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.514.a;Thats my girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.514.b;I find this worrying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.515.desc;It cant be! It just cant be! But it makes so much sense! Ive finally learned why all these years people have been mocking me, cruelly scorning me. My father and mother were siblings, and I am the child of their unholy union. People look down on me just because of my parents sins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.515.a;I hate you mom! I hate you dad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.516.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently learned about the unusual circumstances of [From.GetHerHis] birth. The child has confronted you about this, and though you tried to answer diplomatically, your attempts only frustrated and upset [From.GetHerHim] even more. [From.GetSheHeCap] eventually stormed away, fuming and enraged, ranting and raving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.516.a;I have a bad feeling about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.517.desc;Sir Mordred was the traitorous enemy of King Arthur, a despised villain and murderous lout. Yet why do people compare me to this evil man? Simply because I have flaws, and because I am not on best terms with the King of Britain? This is not flattering at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.517.a;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.518.desc;Everybody knows you dont have the best relationship with [From.GetTitledFirstName], who is considered by [From.GetHerHis] enemies and rivals to be a rather villainous character. In fact, some have compared [From.GetHerHim] to Mordred, the legendary brute and scoundrel who betrayed Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.518.a;He is a villain, and deserves such a reputation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.518.b;This child of mine is trouble indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.519.desc;A most curious man has visited you! A Moor, he claims to be the illegitimate son of one of your lesser knights who died a while back, conceived when this knight traveled to the land of the Mohammedans and had a short affair with a local noblewoman. Wishing to emulate the deeds of King Arthurs Moorish knight, Morien, he will serve you with great loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.519.a;He is welcome at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.520.desc;While traveling, you come to a forest. Theres something different about it something bewitching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.520.a;I wonder why this forest feels so special?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.521.tooltip;You explore the forest for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.521.title;Excalibur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.521.desc;There, before your eyes, is a lake, surrounded by mists and low-hanging trees. But that is not the most unnerving thing - for there, in the middle of the lake, floating as if it were made of feather, is a sword. A bright, gleaming sword, perfectly smooth. Curious, you edge into the lake, trying to get a clearer view of the sword.\n\nYou pick it up. It is surprisingly light, yet you can feel its strength. On one side is etched the words Take me up, and on the other Cast me away.\n\nIt takes a while, but you eventually realize why those words sound so familiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.521.a;Could this sword be the legendary Excalibur?!?!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.522.title;Excaliburs Magic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.522.desc;Somehow somehow, you healed yourself. Somehow. They say the scabbard containing the sword Excalibur has miraculous healing abilities. Maybe it is the cause of this miracle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.522.a;Who knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.523.title;Excalibur's Strength;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.523.desc;How mighty is Excalibur! This is truly the sword of King Arthur, and not a mere replica or fake. You swing your sword in battle, and it is unbreakable, invincible, able to pierce any armor. What fortune you have, to possess such a sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.523.a;Your enemies tremble before Excalibur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.524.title;Excalibur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.524.desc;One of your predecessor's most prized possessions was the sword of King Arthur, Excalibur. With their death, it is only proper that you, the new ruler of Britain, inherit this legendary blade. Unfortunately, the blade is nowhere to be found.\n\nAfter questioning several people, a lesser knight confesses that as your predecessor lay dying, he was instructed to secretly take the sword and throw it back into the lake where it was found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.524.a;Curses! We must travel to that lake at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.525.tooltip;You and your men hurry to the lake. Hopefully it shouldnt be too hard to find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.525.title;Where is Excalibur?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.525.desc;You and your men eventually find the lake, and begin searching desperately for Excalibur. You all unearth every stone, look behind every tree, even dive to the bottom of the lake. But alas, the sword is nowhere to be found. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETceltic.525.a;It is as if it mysteriously vanished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
