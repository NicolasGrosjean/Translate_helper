EVTNAME1000109211;The Rise of the Songhai Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109211;My liege, vague rumors of a powerful African warlord, Sunni Ali, have reached us from the depths of the African savanna. It seems that this warlord is uniting the so-called Songhai peoples into a large empire, expanding at the expense of other neighboring realms. Perhaps these are merely rumors, but who knows what threat this warlord could pose to West Africa, upsetting existing Trans-Saharan trade routes? Could this warlord even invade North Africa and beyond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109214;Conquest of the Savanna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109214;My liege, the great Songhai warlord Sunni Ali and his skilled commander Askia Mohammed have begun moving their mighty armies into Gurma. It seems like they are intent on marching on Timbuktu and capturing the jewel of West Africa! These will be turbulent times for that region indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109214;I fear we may be in for a long fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109214;Um... what’s “Songhai” again? And Gurma? Never heard of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109214;Things are going to get interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000109213;Timbuktu Burnt and Razed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109213;The armies of Songhai have successfully taken Timbuktu after a lengthy siege. Travelers report that the Songhai invaders committed gross iniquity and brutally tortured many people there. The city shall undoubtedly burn for many days and lie in ruin for years. What will become of this city once a center of trade and learning?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109213;This is a sad day! What tyrants are upon us now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109213;What an unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

title_sankar_zouma_desc;In the Malian Empire, the title of "Sankar-Zouma" (derived from the Sankarani region), was traditionally bestowed upon the head of the Kondé clan. The Sankar-Zouma held command over all forces in the south bordering the coastal jungle. His role would have been similar the Farima-Soura in protecting merchants moving in and out of the empire with valuable goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

title_farima_soura_desc;The Farima-Soura, also documented as the Farim-Soura, Faran-Soura or Sura Farin appears to have been a field commander in charge of the northern border. Soura was likely a province or at minimum a large region if the title of the Farim-Kabu is any evidence. His main responsibility would have been monitoring the Saharan border for bandits to keep merchants from being molested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

griot_desc;This character is of the Griot caste. The Griots were West African historians, storytellers, praise singers, poets and/or musicians. The griot is a repository of oral tradition, and is also often seen as something of a societal leader due to his traditional position as an adviser to royal personages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.1.desc;I have searched far and wide for a worthy Griot to serve at my court. He will sing of my ancestors, entertain my people, encourage my warriors, and provide me counsel. At long last, one such man has arrived at my court, but I am not sure whether he is worthy... A ruler must choose his griot wisely, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#wafrica.4.desc;The people of your court are incredulous. “Great [Root.GetTitle],” they might say, “it is a shame that you do not have a Griot at court! Are you to be like a trader without his camel, a warrior without his spear, a farmer without his seeds?” No self-respecting ruler of the savanna can go without a Griot, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

title_court_griot_desc;"Griot" is a modern-day term used to describe a caste of highly influential individuals in West African society. Griots were, and still are, historians, advisors, arbitrators, praise singers, and storytellers. Nobles and royalty always had Griots. In traditional West Africa, no griot can be without a lord, and no lord can be without a griot. The two are inseparable, and worthless without the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

host_griot_performance_desc;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.16.desc;Typically my Griot only provides performances to a select few at my court, entertaining us with stories, histories, jokes, and more. It is time that I organize something on a grander scale for the entire community. As a display of my capacity as [Root.GetTitle], I shall host a great performance led by my Griot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.16.a;Let me tell my Griot my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.39.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] discusses [Root.GetHerHis] plan with [Root.GetHerHis] Griot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.39.desc;“A good idea,” my Griot says, as we discuss my plan. “I will make preparations as soon as I can. You too, my liege, do your part in organizing this. Let the community know of your generosity!”\n\n”What sort of things are you planning to do?” I ask my Griot. “You must do many things - praise my ancestors, entertain the people, recall histories and great legends...”\n\n”Worry not,” my Griot says. “I think I have a good idea of what to do for this year’s performance. Just wait and see, my liege - as always, I will not disappoint. You and the community will be very much entertained. It will only be a matter of time.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.39.name;Preparing and Organizing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.39.a;I can hardly wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.33.desc;Your Griot has already given many wonderful performances! You and your audience are eager to hear more. Will your Griot tell of your ancestors’ heroic deeds next? Or maybe he’ll recount another adventure of the lazy genius Ouati and the ever-curious Kadi? Or perhaps he’ll start teasing some more people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.33.a;Let us hear more, my Griot, let us hear more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.34.desc;What another wonderful series of performances by your Griot - it’s too bad these sort of large performances only happen every now and then. Everyone is amazed at how your Griot is able to spend hours on end recalling histories and legends, comedies and adventures, all from memory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.34.a;Maybe next time I can hear another story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.17.desc;Today my Griot sings of my ancestors’ heroic exploits. Look as he strums his kora harp! But his voice falters - is he tired? One of the audience members interrupts and makes some helpful criticism, as is custom among our people: “Perhaps your rhythm is too fast, respected Griot.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.17.a;Indeed, I agree. Sing slowly - we wish to ponder all you say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.17.b;No, I think his rhythm is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.17.c;No, be livelier! Imagine what my ancestor felt hunting elephants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.18.desc;“The Hunters approached Chief Nuh, and wished an audience,” your Griot sings, as he continues his story. “But the Chief disagreed. ‘Nay,’ cried he, ‘I shall not meet with these beggars and scavengers.’” Someone in the audience cries, “What a fool Nuh is! To reject the mighty, nyama-wielding hunters!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.18.a;The hunters are powerful like Griots and Blacksmiths indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.18.b;If I remember this story right, Chief Nuh has a good reason for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.19.desc;“[Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor had to be careful as he snuck in the house, for though the wicked merchant was fat from all the food he ate, he was still sly like a hyena, and could hear even the smallest of sounds,” says your Griot, as he recounts a tale to your court. “But the wicked merchant had to be taught a lesson. Fate was on the side of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor. Though his cunning, he stole all of the wicked merchant’s baklava.”\nYour audience claps and cheers. Very good! That wicked merchant had it coming. So your Griot continues, “On eating one, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor remarked, ‘Wondrous is this delicacy eaten by the Greeks, heirs of Alexander the Great! A pity the wicked merchant had no recipes to steal!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.19.name;The Wicked Merchant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.19.a;Bravo, bravo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.19.b;I wish my ancestor could have stolen the recipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.20.desc;“How many piled-up ruins! But all the deeds I have spoken of today took place long ago. [Root.GetTitle]s have succeeded [Root.GetTitle]s, but the land has always remained the same. So it was, so it is, and so it will be.” With that, your Griot concludes his story for the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.20.a;A good tale! Tomorrow, why don’t you tell the story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.21.desc;“But [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s father was brave, and mighty, and though his companions fled, he did not retreat when the lion came. He raised his spear, for he was ready to fight the lion. Then...” Your Griot pauses for dramatic effect, as everyone imagines the lion and your father circling each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.21.a;And then? And then? What happens next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.21.b;Wait a moment... my father never told me about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.21.c;My father didn’t kill lions, my Griot is making it all up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.22.desc;“And Guimba the Tyrant died, the victim of the trap and his own hubris,” your Griot sings, ending the story. “Thus it is so, that tyrants will always fall, defeated by righteous men who follow the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. This is nothing but fate, for who can deny fate? One cannot change it.”\nYour Griot looks up, smiling, as he pauses for a moment. He then resumes playing his kora harp. “The universe has mysteries which none can fathom, even us Griots. Perhaps you will be born a great and mighty king - you can do nothing about it. Perhaps you will be unlucky and become a beggar - you can do nothing about it. Each man finds his way already marked for him and he can change nothing of it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.22.name;Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.22.a;Fate is quite a powerful thing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.22.b;Fate is a silly idea used to scare children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.23.desc;Today your Griot recounts your entire genealogy, to remind your court of the great men and women from which you descend. It is amazing, is it not, that your Griot knows so much about so many people who lived long ago? Even you learn new things about your ancestors now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.23.a;Amazing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x	
wafrica.23.b;I bet my Griot made some of that up and made it sound convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.23.c;Actually, my Griot, you made a mistake about my great-great-great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.24.desc;“The lad Ouati was a clever genius despite his laziness, always impressing the excitable, ever-curious lass Kadi with his mind,” your Griot sings, as he begins his performance. “Today, if you wish, I will tell of the two. Today, I will tell of how they and their friends solved another mystery in their village, the mystery of the iced cream...”\n\n”No, no,” one of your audience members interrupt, as is typical custom, “Tell us the one when the sorceress Nemiss tricked Ouati into doing her bidding!” Yet another member of your court, a scholarly sort, speaks his opinion, “I want to hear the one where Ouati and his friends debate about the mysteries of anger.” One more person speaks out, saying, “Those stories aren’t as exciting as the one with the Persian siblings and the bristle toothbrush!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.24.name;Ouati and Kadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.24.a;So many choices. Good thing my Griot can tell them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.25.desc;“‘I’m curious at what you’re thinking,’ said the lass Kadi, as the lad Ouati tried to figure out a way to escape the trap,” your Griot tells, continuing the story. “‘How will we escape these lions?’” You don’t know how, but in your heart you know the lazy genius Ouati always figures out a way out of the situation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.25.a;I’m curious too! What’s his ingenious solution this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.25.b;Ha, I’ve already figured this one, Ouati will use Kadi’s headscarf to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.26.desc;“‘...where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Abubakari!’” your Griot sings in the melodramatic voice of the evil, shapeshifting sorcerer-king Abubakari. Indeed, you wonder, how will the warrior Soumaoro Yaqub undo Abubakari’s evil rule? Surely, the great villain Abu - as everyone calls him - is more than a mere sorcerer - he is a god, in a way.\nAs your Griot continues playing the song of Soumaoro Yaqub on his kora harp, you and your audience can’t wait to hear more of Soumaoro Yaqub’s endless quest to defeat the evil Abu. You’ve heard most of the stories about Soumaoro Yaqub, but you always enjoy hearing them again. Will your Griot tell of when the monkeys taught Yaqub learned to jump well? Or when Yaqub assisted the 300 Greek warriors against the Cattle-men?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.26.name;The Evil that is Abu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.26.a;How about the one when Yaqub lost all his clothes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.27.desc;The audience roars with laughter as your Griot mimics your style of speech and movement during his performance. You can only grimace or do a weak laugh, for you know that the Griots have the right to mock and insult anyone, including their patron, even if that patron is a powerful [Root.GetTitle] like yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.27.a;Ah, well, it’s not that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.27.b;Fools! You’ll all pay for this... somehow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.27.c;Oh no, let me show you how you should do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.28.desc;“There lies a fabled land far, far away,” your Griot says in a low-tone, powerful and suspenseful. “This is a fearsome, barren land, where the fabled one-legged, one-eyed men live, they who are heathen cannibals! Today, the warrior Soumaoro Yaqub, in his quest to defeat the evil Abubakari, travels there...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.28.a;Will Soumaoro Yaqub undo Abubakari’s evil again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.28.b;Any scholar knows one-legged men live south of us, and they aren’t cannibals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.29.desc;Today your Griot tells one of the comedic adventures of the perverted youth, Ali-Ali, who is always a lecher around pretty girls. But Ali-Ali also possesses some magical powers, being a sorcerer-in-training, so he always has to fight strange monstrosities terrorizing his village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.29.a;Is he facing the evil crab again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.30.desc;“There once was a bandit named Ridwan the Red,” your Griot sings, beginning his performance for the day, “who came riding to Oualata from old Timbuktu, and the braggart did swagger and brandish his spear, as he told of bold battles and gold he had stole...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.30.a;Who’s going to humiliate that braggart this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.31.desc;“There was a land far, far away, that was once threatened by a flying menace,” your Griot says, as he recounts yet another tale. “The flying monsters were great and many, like a swarm of locusts - who would, who could, kill them all? None, until came the once-imprisoned, saintly Kibu’u...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.31.a;Tell us more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.31.b;Bah, I’ve heard other Griots sing the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.32.desc;“You’ve solved this mystery and helped me much,’ the sorceress Namiss said, congratulating the lad Ouati, that lazy genius,” as your Griot continues his tale. But your audience is incredulous. One of your courtiers says, confused, “That makes no sense, that can’t be the ending, and Ouati... isn’t Namiss - “;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.32.a;Something is not right here... this story might not be over just yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.32.b;Wait, I’ve heard this one before - the fools don’t see a plot twist coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.35.desc;What comedic adventures will Ali-Ali go through today? You listen eagerly as your Griot begins to tell another tale of the perverted young sorcerer, Ali-Ali.\n“The clever little snail goddess, Nana, greeted our hero the lusty Ali-Ali. ‘I greet you, Ali-Ali-Ali!’ she said mischievously to her friend,” your Griot sings. “‘My name is not Ali-Ali-Ali!’ said Ali-Ali, ‘It is Ali-Ali!’ To which Nana replied, ‘Sorry, I stuttered!’ And Ali-Ali said, ‘Do you mean it wasn’t on purpose? You! You silly snail! Don’t make me do something nasty!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.35.name;Ali-Ali? Or Ali-Ali-Ali?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.35.a;Wait, is it Arabi-Ali... Al-Hajj-Ali... Ali-Ali-Ali-Ali?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.35.b;I’d like to eat some snail now that my Griot mentions it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.35.c;I definitely know what Ali-Ali means by “nasty.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.36.desc;“[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is just , is [Root.GetSheHe] not? [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is kind, is [Root.GetSheHe] not? [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is mighty, is [Root.GetSheHe] not?” Your Griot sings as he plays his kora harp, the audience watching with rapt attention. “Indeed our [Root.GetTitle] is great, is [Root.GetSheHe] not?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.36.a;Very good, very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.36.b;No, this praise is too much...  I have faults too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.36.c;This is not enough praise - speak of my other strengths!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.36.d;I can’t believe the audience listens to and believes this nonsense about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.37.desc;As part of his performance, your Griot steps back and forth solemnly as he chants praises to the ancestors of your clan. There is something dignified yet eerie about him as he marches around. “In the beginning was the Word,” your Griot once told you, “And then Music. Like smiths who learned to create and destroy through tools, so too did we Griots learn to create and destroy through Word, and through Music.”\n\nSuddenly, a child in your court runs out towards the Griot. You grab the boy and pull him back. “Be careful!” you whisper in a harsh tone. “Do you know who that is? Did your parents tell you nothing? If you cross the path of the Griots, you may die! If they touch you, and they wish it, you may die!” This is no superstition - in your heart, you know this to be true. The Griot is truly a fearsome being who possesses great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.37.name;The Griot's Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.37.a;Even a [Root.GetTitle] such as myself must be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.37.b;Even for all my skepticism, I cannot be skeptical of the Griot’s power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.38.desc;Today, your Griot will take some time to tell fanciful tales to the children at your court. As you stand nearby, you can’t help but smile a bit as you recall your own childhood, and how your father’s Griot used to tell you exciting tales about the gods and heroes of your people.\n“What story should I tell?” your Griot asks, speaking to his audience, mostly children. “What of the trickster, Anansi the spider, who taught people how to weave cloth? Or how about the clever but lazy Ouati, who can solve any problem? Or what of the great warrior Soumaoro Yaqub, who seeks to undo the evil that is Abubakari?” The children all shout in chaotic disunion, as they demand to hear their favorite stories. You laugh a bit - you were once like that too, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.38.name;Children's Stories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.38.a;As long as my Griot doesn't sing about Ali-Ali the lusty sorcerer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.40.desc;As your Griot finishes yet another performance, the memory of all he has told us these past few days still rings fresh in your mind. Who knew the young sorcerer Ali-Ali could be so lustful, to scavenge after the dirty clothes of young maidens? Who knew my grandfather actually wrestled with five elephants? Who knew how the lazy genius Ouati got out of trouble yet again? And who knew I had so many good qualities?\nYour Griot knew all this. He once said, “My word is pure and free of untruth. It is the word of my father, his father, and his father, and so on as far back as anyone can remember.”\nYes. It must be so. It must have been since time immemorial. So you remember your Griot’s words, “Griots do not know what lying is.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.40.name;Knowing Everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.40.a;But for now, I should pay full attention to my Griot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.41.desc;The trickster spirits are always a good topic for the Griots to talk about. Their stories are always full of mischievousness, perfect for all audiences. And so it is that your Griot tells about one such trickster today.\n”One day the trickster Takoi wore a hat, white on one side and red the other,” your Griot sings. “As he walked down the road, some people said his hat was white, but others said it was red. The people began to bicker about the color. White! Red! Red! White! They got so angry, they began to fight and hurt each other. Seeing this, Takoi laughed, exclaiming, ‘People will fight over anything!’”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.41.name;The Trickster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.41.a;Ha, what silly people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.41.b;People tend to be like this all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.42.desc;Your Griot continues, “The hero Soumaoro Yaqub came across a strange man from Frangistan, a one-legged warrior wielding a large sword - “\n”The man shouldn’t be from Frangistan,” one of your courtiers interrupts. He suggests something else, as is custom, “I think he should be a Persian!”\n “Make him a Roman! From Constantinople! Romans are amazing,” says another member of the audience.\n”Whoever likes the decadent Romans are imbeciles,” cuts in another person, “The warrior should be from mystical Cathay!”\nAs the audience continues arguing, you see your Griot looks rather confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.42.name;From Where?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.42.a;Ignore the fools, choose whatever you want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.42.b;I think the warrior should come from...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.43.desc;“And you,” your Griot sings, looking at one of your courtiers, “the people say you eat too much, and your feces are of many colors - yellow, blue, red, green, purple!”\nThe audience laughs as your gluttonous courtier blushes in embarrassment. “And you,” the Griot sings, continuing his tirade of mockery, “You there, the people say you are a lech, like the young sorcerer Ali-Ali was - but you are three times his age. What are you doing, chasing your granddaughter’s friends, dirty old man?”\nAnd now the Griot turns to yet another person. “And you, ah, you. The people say...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.43.name;And You, And You;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.43.a;Don’t you dare insult me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.43.b;My Griot, talk about my flaws too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.43.c;Talk of my children, that they learn from their flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.44.desc;“Of whose ancestors should I speak?” your Griot shouts, “Should I speak of your lineage of leatherworkers, Bonga? For I knew your grandfather well, he was a hard-working man. Or, perhaps, I should tell of your mighty lineage of hunters, Kassa?”\nA few members of the audience make their suggestions, before your Griot decides. “Very well! Listen then to my word, for I will tell you of the ancestors of the jeweler Sakoura. They are brave men, this lineage, who show their strength not through force of arms like warriors or hunters, but through their craft and through their shrewdness. Let me tell of how Sakoura’s great-grandfather Fodi foiled the evil Tuareg chief Ilyas with his wits, with nothing but some Greek pastries and some silver rings...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.44.name;Whose Ancestor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.44.a;Now this sounds like a good story...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.45.tooltip;Preparations for the performance are made - everybody can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.45.desc;The day of the performance has dawned. Your Griot, dressed in his finest attire, holds in his hand a kora harp - the sweet, delicate, yet powerful instrument of the griots - as he presents himself before the community. What sort of stories will he tell? What sort of people will he mock? What ancestors will he honor? For the next few days, you and the community will bear witness to these, and more, perhaps for hours on end.\n\nIt is custom among the peoples of the savanna that the audience can make suggestions (or even constructive criticisms) to the Griot throughout his performance. Since you are the highest-ranked member of the community present, your Griot allows you to make a suggestion first. “What would I like to hear?” you think to yourself. There are so many things to hear of - too many, for the Griots know much. So many choices indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.45.name;The Show Begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.45.a;I think we should start with the story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.100.name;A Comedy of Errors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.100.desc;The audience roars with laughter as your griot recalls a tale of blunders. In this one, a poor woman, due to her stupidity, ends up marrying two men by accident! It doesn't help that her two husbands are also buffoons as well.\n\nEven the most serious-faced of your courtiers have a hard time suppressing their laughter when your griot acts out each of the characters, their ridiculous mannerisms and the slapstick comedy they get themselves into.\n\nHow will these idiots ever solve their dilemma? Will the woman be able to settle with one of her husbands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.100.a;You laugh and laugh again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.101.name;Fables for the Children;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.101.desc;Today your griot is spending time telling stories aimed at the children. These are simpler fare, without the darker themes or more complex plots and characters found in tales meant for adults. Oftentimes, these stories have a moral of some sort. To you, as an adult, such morals are obvious - "obey your parents," or "be kind to one another," or "do not be too greedy" for instance - but to the children, who don't know any better, they are simply mesmerized by the rivalry between the lion and the elephant, or the amusing antics of the rabbit, or the cunning of the shepherd boy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.101.a;These are good, wholesome stories, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.102.name;Koi-Koi the Fake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.102.desc;You immediately recognize the mischievously ominous melody your griot plays. It seems like your griot is telling a story with Koi-Koi the Fake, an enemy of Ali-Ali the perverted sorcerer. Unlike Ali-Ali, a paragon of justice, Koi-Koi is a fraud, a scam, a cheat, who admits to lying about his abilities as a sorcerer... but then again, Koi-Koi could be lying about lying about his abilities, and he could be much more powerful than he looks. Who knows?\n\nNevertheless, he is a popular character, charismatic and sympathetic despite his morally dubious nature, and many of your female courtiers have even claimed they prefer husbands like him! Even you have to admit you enjoy a story from Koi-Koi's cynical, rational point of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.102.a;I still prefer the lusty, comical, but just and noble Ali-Ali, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.102.b;Koi-Koi is better than the impulsive, overly righteous, young Ali-Ali.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.103.name;Hawa's End?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.103.desc;Shocking! Why would Hawa, wife of the perverted sorcerer Ali-Ali, seek the aid of their enemy, the fraudster Koi-Koi the Fake, who once scammed her?\n\nYou listen carefully, as your Griot relays their conversation, skillfully changing his tone back and forth as he speaks the witty banter between these two snide, sarcastic characters. It is an absolute joy to hear!\n\nIt seems Hawa and Ali-Ali are in grave danger indeed, so her desperation is understandable. Apparently Ali-Ali, faithful to Hawa despite his lusty nature, rejected the advances of a mighty snake goddess who now wants them dead, and only Koi-Koi has the skills to defeat her, by deceiving her into forgetting about Ali-Ali and Hawa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.103.a;How will Koi-Koi deceive this goddess, to save Ali-Ali and Hawa?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.104.name;No More Cliches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.104.desc;Uh-oh. In the middle of your griot's performance, some members of the audience - mostly rowdy young men - start to complain about what they see as cliches. They say that your griot is singing another tale featuring the same sort of plots, the same sort of characters, the same sort of humor and themes. Other audience members, particularly the older ones, come to the defense of your griot, arguing that the youths don't know what a good quality is, and that they should learn to recognize the finer and subtler differences between each tale  and appreciate the depth these stories can have.\n\nYour griot turns to you, and asks for your opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.104.a;I want something different... something experimental and revolutionary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.104.b;I like the old stories. Repetitive, yes, but there's a reason why they’re around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.105.name;Honoring the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.105.desc;Unlike yesterday's rowdy, comedic routine, today your griot's performances are more serious in nature. The haunting, dark melodies he plays stir your emotions, as he recalls the past. He tells of the ancestors of your tribe - their heroic deeds as they used their cunning and courage to fight their enemies, the dilemmas they faced as to whether to sacrifice this or that, the trials they dealt with when it seemed all was against them. Some of these tales do not end happily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.105.a;But there was always hope - otherwise, we wouldn't be here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.106.desc;Your griot can criticize and mock anyone during these performances, as part of his routine, and no one can do anything about it. Today, during his performance, your griot has some particularly interesting songs about one of your courtiers - embarassing, yes, but also very amusing. As everyone laughs, your courtier glances around nervously, face red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.106.a;It's like they don't want to be here, huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.107.desc;"That plot was terrible," exclaims one of your courtiers,as your griot finishes his story for the day. "It jumped around without reason, it made no sense if you think about it..." As your courtier goes on and on, you realize he has a point. That last story wasn't particularly strong, and it had many flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.107.a;I hope the stories tomorrow will be more riveting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.107.b;It was still enjoyable, that's the most important thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.108.name;Yaqub is Naked;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.108.desc;Today, Soumaoro Yaqub is the focus of the tale your griot tells. It begins calmly, peacefully, as the heroic warrior removes his clothes and enters the water naked to rest and bathe himself. But - what's this?\n\nEverybody starts laughing as your griot mimics Yaqub's shock when he sees someone stealing his clothes! But too late, as soon as he leaves the water, the culprit is nearly out of sight, running towards a city nearby. Now our hero must find this thief and avoid embarrassing himself with his nudity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.108.a;Continue the story, my griot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.109.name;Yaqub and the Warrior Woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.109.desc;As your griot continues telling another take about Soumaoro Yaqub, you bite on your nails in apprehension, as you realize that Yaqub's new companion is no beautiful warrior princess claiming to also fight against the evil sorcerer-lord Abu, she IS Abu in disguise!\n\nIt is so obvious to you now, the way this "princess" acts and speaks. Abu's disguise is no doubt clever and cunning, and you wonder how Yaqub is going to get out of the inevitable trap, and why Abu is doing this in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.109.a;Be careful, Yaqub!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.110.name;Fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.110.desc;So your griot sings about how the great warrior Soumaoro Yaqub, yet again, charges into battle against the sorcerer Abubakari! But today, the evil lord Abu says: "Foolish Soumaoro! Stop right there. Why are you fighting me like this? Don't you realize the same thing happens every time? You attack me, I shout 'Fool, you shall never defeat me,' and then fly away, only for us to repeat it over and over again."\n\nYour griot tells about how Yaqub muses over this for a moment, before saying, "You will not fool me with your treachery, evil demon!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.110.a;Seriously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.111.name;Yaqub vs. Abu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.111.desc;Your griot continues the story: Just as Yaqub is about to charge at Abubakari again, the sorcerer turns himself into a giant bird, shouting, "Fool, you shall never defeat me!" as he flies away. He then magically reappears moments later before Yaqub, saying, "See what I mean?"\n\nThus Abu offers Yaqub a deal: they will fight at an agreed location, man-to-man, no sorcery, no magical weapons, just their own pure strength against each other. Yaqub agrees to it, but you can tell based on your griot's intonation of their voices that the two clearly plan to cheat despite their agreement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.111.a;I wonder what tricks these two enemies have up their sleeves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Receive Iron Woman ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
receive_iron_woman;Receive Iron Woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
receive_iron_woman_desc;Go to a blacksmith and request for your own "Iron Woman," a special ceremonial spear or staff with magical powers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.5.desc;“Indeed, the blacksmiths possess much power,” my Griot tells me. “It is they who know most of ‘nyama,’ the force which controls all society and the universe, for they can fashion great things out of nothing. It is they who possess spiritual knowledge greater than even us Griots. Respected and feared by our people, they are the greatest of the ‘nyamakalaw’ castes, who can shape nyama into art.”\n\nMy Griot thus agrees that it is about time I receive a powerful artefact from one of these blacksmiths to demonstrate the power I myself possess as a [Root.GetTitle]. As my Griot suggests, “It is time you ask for a so-called ‘iron woman,’ a ceremonial spear or staff imbued by magical power. With it, the world will know of you as a mighty leader of men.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.5.a;Let’s go to the blacksmith, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wafrica.6.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] visits the blacksmith and asks for the “iron woman” to be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.6.desc;I approach the blacksmith as he strikes his steel and forges his products. He is an imposing figure - indeed this is the sort of man who controls “nyama,” the life force, one who can create and destroy! I come to him humbly, and make my request for the “iron woman.”\n\nThe blacksmith, thankfully, is more than happy to oblige. “This is a good and important ask, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], and one I will do with uttermost care, so it will take some time,” he tells me. “However, I must ask you something. Because the ‘Iron Woman’ represents you and your power, I believe it should represent an aspect of your rule or yourself you find important. What do you think is most important, for you, as a ruler?” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.6.a;Power and authority are needed for any ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.6.b;Wisdom and spirituality are the greatest things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.6.c;Society and my people - I care most about those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wafrica.9.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] waits for the blacksmith to wield the “nyama” and create his staff of community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.7.desc;Some time has passed, and I have received word that my “Iron Woman” is finished. My griot and I travel a great distance, back to the blacksmith’s forge. “This is a powerful ‘Iron Woman,’” he says, as he hands it to me. “Use it wisely.” Even I can feel the raw energy emulating from it. I can definitely sense the power of the “nyamakalaw,” like this blacksmith, who control the forces of the universe.\nAs we come back to my residence, my Griot comments on my new symbol of power. Nodding sagely, my Griot warns, “Your authority is supreme - your soldiers shall be heartened, your servants loyal, your enemies afraid. But remember, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], power is good only if it is used justly.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.7.a;And so I shall be a great and noble ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.7.name;Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.8.desc;Some time has passed, and I have received word that my “Iron Woman” is finished. My griot and I travel a great distance, back to the blacksmith’s forge. “I can see great spirit coming from this ‘Iron Woman,’” he says, as he hands it to me. As I receive it, I feel the spirit of the ancestors blessing me. I can definitely sense the power of the “nyamakalaw,” like this blacksmith, who control the forces of the universe.\nAs we come back to my residence, my Griot comments on my new symbol of wisdom. My Griot smiles as I show him the artefact. He tells me, “It is good that you value wisdom and respect the forces of nature, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. May this be of use to you throughout your reign.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.8.a;May it be so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.8.name;Wisdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.9.desc;Some time has passed, and I have received word that my “Iron Woman” is finished. My griot and I travel a great distance, back to the blacksmith’s forge. “This ‘Iron Woman’ is a beautiful but useful artefact, I think,” he says, as he hands it to me. It may be a ceremonial tool, but I sense the spirit of my entire community in it. I can definitely sense the power of the “nyamakalaw,” like this blacksmith, who control the forces of the universe.\nAs we come back to my residence, my Griot comments on my new symbol of the community. He remarks, “A ruler who does not understand that which he rules is not a good ruler. May you, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], learn of and understand how to best serve your people.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.9.a;That too is my wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.9.name;Community;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.10.desc;As [Root.GetTitle], I have done well so far. My court is host to a good Griot, for instance. Yet, I can’t help but feel like I could be doing more to prove my worth as a [Root.GetTitle]. Perhaps I should wield an artefact of power, crafted by a skilled blacksmith. I should ask my Griot for advice on this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.10.a;What have you to say, o Griot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bilal_descendant_desc;This character's dynasty was the first to establish a certain major West African state. The dynasty claims descent from Bilal ibn-Rabah, an Ethiopian slave who became one of the Prophet Mohammed's closest companions and was said to have been the first to call Muslims to prayer (the Adhan). Local oral tradition says one of Bilal's sons came to West Africa, where he sired this character's dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

noble_stranger_descendant_desc;This character's dynasty was the first to establish a certain major West African state. According to local oral tradition, this dynasty is descended from a stranger of royal blood who came to this character's ancestral homeland centuries ago. This stranger was brave and just, and as a result gained a position of power and prestige among the local populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.11.desc;You are now a [Root.GetTitle], a master of men, your Griot tells you. You must be a just ruler, who is harsh with criminals but generous with his common subjects. You must be a brave ruler, who wages war against deluded enemies and evil-minded sorcerers. You must be a wise ruler, who consults the Griots, good sorcerers, and diviners. But you too must know your origins, who your ancestors were. A great [Root.GetTitle] is nothing without a proven line of descent from great heroes.\nYour Griot has done well, however, at determining your ancestry. You and your family are descended from the Ethiopian Bilal, true and steadfast companion of the Prophet Muhammed, the one who called the first call to prayer in the Muslim world. From now on, all across the House of Islam shall speak of your lineage in awe, and you shall be counted among the greatest heroes of the [Root.Culture.GetName] people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wafrica.12.a;That is good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.12.b;The Muslims sure have interesting ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wafrica.13.desc;You are now a [Root.GetTitle], a master of men. But there is no rest for the weary, your Griot counsels. Now is the time to establish just rule. Now is the time to show courage. Now is the time to revel in the wisdom of the ancestors. Few men throughout history have commanded such power and authority in the savannas of West Africa. It is important that you clearly establish your lineage in order to assure your position and the position of your family.\nThankfully, your Griot is skilled, and has determined your ancestry. You and your family originate from a mysterious stranger, who was the Prince of a great kingdom far away. This noble man was so great in justness, valor, and goodness that he was elevated to a chief of the [Root.Culture.GetName] people. As such you claim descent from such a great hero, it is likely you and your heirs will continue to emulate such greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
