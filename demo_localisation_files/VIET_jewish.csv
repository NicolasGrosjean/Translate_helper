#Israel and Aliyah;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.0.desc;You have done the impossible and restored the holy land to Jewish rule. Someday, perhaps soon, Jews all over the world will speak your name in awe and honor you as a hero in the vein of Moses, David, or Judah Maccabee. The future of this new Kingdom of Israel is far from certain, for we are surrounded by enemeies near and far, but at least we know that today, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] has delivered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.0.name;Israel Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.0.a;So begins a new chapter in the history of the Jewish people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.1.desc;We have successfully conquered Israel from the heathen Jews. The Kingdom of Israel, as a concept, is not relevant to our people, so it shall now be known as the Kingdom of Jerusalem again. Shall the Jews reclaim the now-destroyed Israel, or shall Israel once again fade away, a distant memory kept alive by the dreams of the Jewish people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.1.a;Only time will tell what happens next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.1.name;The Jews Lose Israel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.2.name;Israel Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.2.desc;Tragedy descends once more upon the Chosen People! We Jews remember when Jerusalem was sacked - first by the Babylonians and second by the Romans. Now, it seems that history has repeated itself as the Kingdom of Israel falls to our enemies.\n\nWhat injustice have we done in the past to deserve this? Surely, the ways of Yahweh are mysterious, but to lose Israel again is shocking and catastrophic indeed. Still, we have survived terrible situations before, and we shall survive this one as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.2.a;We shall one day reclaim Israel, somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.4.desc;Since the restoration of Israel, many of our fellow Jews from around the world have “made aliyah,” or returned, to Israel.

VIETjewish.15.desc;My dynasty has done the impossible. We have restored Israel to the Jewish people. Many of my advisors, however, believe it is important I find “proof” that I am descended from King David. It would legitimize my rule even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.15.a;Yes, I think it’s important we find this “proof.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETjewish.15.b;No, I cannot fabricate such a thing, it goes against my conscience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

passover.1.desc;It is now the night before Passover. As head of my court, it is proper that I partake in one final, formal search for Chametz. With all the lights blown out, save for the candle I hold in my hands, I scour my castle with utmost diligence and attention, making sure there is no Chametz remaining, whether it is in the kitchens, my bedroom, or my servant’s quarters. If by misfortune any are remaining tomorrow, when Passover begins, I will make sure to burn it while repeating the declaration of biyur chametz, declaring any chametz that may not have been found to be null and void "as the dust of the earth".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At the table are delicious foods, cooked specifically for Passover.\nToday, we commemorate the day our ancestors escaped Egypt when Moses split the Red Sea apart before drowning all of Pharaoh’s warriors. A great day it was, and a sign of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]’s watchful eye over the Children of Israel, as the holy men are wont to remind all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

passover.6.a;And now, back to normal life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.7.desc;During Passover I’ve been trying very hard to not eat anything made with Chametz. But it is rather difficult! How can I eat delicious foods like soft, succulent breads and syrupy pastries? Sometimes, it’s just so hard to resist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.7.a;However, I can persist. It’s only a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.7.b;I can’t resist! Forgive me, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.8.desc;Today, as part of Passover, we are all reciting the "Shir ha-Shirim" or the "Song of Songs." So we all begin to sing, in ancient Hebrew, "The song of songs, which is Solomon's...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

passover.9.desc;During Passover, instead of eating normal breads and such, we can only eat Matzo, made of unleavened grains. Matzo bread, matzo balls, matzo noodles, matzo fried with eggs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.9.a;It's bland, but reminds me to be humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.10.desc;While the servants are cleaning up the remains of the seder meal, I observe the zroa laying on the table. It is a goat or sheep's shank bone, meant to represent the sacrifices once made and eaten in the Temple of Jerusalem during Passover in ancient times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.10.a;There is much to think about here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.11.desc;During this year's Passover, a Jewish merchant from a far-off land is also with us. However, the Jewish community he hails from has different kosher laws then us. His laws thus allow him to eat foods we can't on Passover, but some of my courtiers aren't pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.11.a;He will have to obey our laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.11.b;We should respect his laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover.12.desc;During Passover, we usually eat bitter herbs to remind us of the bitterness our forebears experienced during the exodus from Egypt. Though I have done this many times before, it is always difficult to eat these herbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1000109022;One of my Jewish courtiers is well-known for his great knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Today, out of boredom, we decided to begin a religious debate. So far, it’s been interesting debating against a Jew. As of now, things are starting to get really heated...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109022;But you see, in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], it says that...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109023;While we disagreed on many points, our dicussion was nevertheless very enlightening. In fact, we were so engrossed in our debate that by the time we finished, it was already sunrise!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1000109024;I should never have this kind of debate again. Our disagreements were too many, and I really felt frustrated with the man.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1000109025;Oh Jerusalem...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109026;Today, while walking in the courtyard, you find one of your Jewish courtiers singing a haunting, ancient Jewish song. Even though you don’t understand it, you feel the sadness, the melancholy, the nostalgia, the sehnsucht of the lyrics. You watch her sing for a while, and after she finishes, you decide to approach her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109026;Very soothing and soulful indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1000109028;While privately discussing the finances  of your realm with one of your Jewish courtiers, the courtier suddenly makes a request. Nervously, he says: “My liege, the Jewish people are suffering greatly this year, being forced to pay the Jizya tax when we are in such an impoverished situation. To alleviate the problems of the Jewry, would it hurt to slightly reduce this tax?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109028;Very well. I will temporarily reduce taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109028;No. Be thankful I don’t treat you like the Christians do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC1000109027;[From.GetFirstName] has told me that [From.GetSheHe] appreciates that I have been very kind to the Jews in my realm, even inviting some like [From.GetHerHim] to be in my court, and that for this reason many Jews here admire and respect me.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#EVTOPTB1000109027;Just because I don’t treat you badly doesn’t mean I like you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109029;After having a number of Jews in my court for such a long time, I’ve gotten to know them better, and I’ve begun to reconsider my hatred of them. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions as a Christian has? Perhaps Jews can be good and just people too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109029;No! Such ideas are deceptions by the devil!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109029;Perhaps I shouldn’t be so hardheaded about these matters...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109029;We’re all children of God, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109029;As a just ruler, I must treat all subjects equally, based on their merits.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1000109031;A Jewish courtier, [From.GetFirstName], has recently requested that you allow a distant cousins to take refuge in your court.

EVTOPTB1000109031;I can help provide him a temporary home in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB1000109033;No! I don’t want that sort of man near me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109034;Apparently, the Jewish physician is just as skilled as your courtier said. Your illness has completely gone away, and you feel even stronger than you were before your illness started. This must be a miracle of sorts!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109034;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for the physician! Here’s his payment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
