zhongguo.0.name;The Kara-Khitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.0.desc;There are rumors of chaos in the Far East. Merchants speak of how the Middle Kingdom struggles to contain yet another wave of nomadic invasions, this time by a group calling themselves the Jurchen. The Jurchen have supplanted the once-mighty Khitan, or the Liao Dynasty, that once ruled China. Now, remnants of the Buddha-worshipping, Sinicized Khitan march across the ancient Silk Road, under the leadership of a wise and cunning Prince of the Liao Dynasty, Yelu Dashi, who has proclaimed himself the true, legitimate ruler of China. Countless realms and peoples have declared themselves vassals to these powerful and cultured Khitan. As the Khitan continue eastwards, it seems these “refugees” are headed straight to Central Asia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.0.a;Quite a fanciful tale! Helpless “refugees” don’t conquer nations, ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.1.name;Civilizing the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.1.desc;In their search for a new homeland following their defeat by the Jurchen, the Khitan have arrived in Central Asia. Seeking to establish a new homeland, the Khitan armies shall not rest until their conquest is complete. Their enemies should be most worried, for the Khitan are not the average nomadic conqueror - besides their military skills inherited from their nomadic ancestors, they also possess both the administrative and engineering knowledge of the Chinese they ruled over and learned from.\n\nIt would be foolish to underestimate the Khitan. What is certain is that they intend to rebuild the great Empire of China in Central Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.1.a;We will civilize these insolent barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.1.b;I, for one, welcome our new Chinese overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.1.c;The Chinese are coming?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.2.desc;What good fortune! A large group Khitan refugees - including some members of the imperial clan - fleeing from the dishonorable Jurchen have found their way to our court. They include a number of capable soldiers, who will undoubtedly serve us as we establish order in these uncivilized, barbarian realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.2.a;May our great civilization flourish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.3.name;The Khitan Settle Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.3.desc;Their invasion of Central Asia successful, the Khitan have, thankfully, halted their advance into the Middle East. Perhaps they only desired a new homeland, after all, and they now seem to be establishing a new Chinese Empire in Central Asia. Many say the Khitan are a cosmopolitan, civilized Chinese dynasty, who rule their people justly and live an unmatched life of sophistry and culture, better rulers in any case than the bloodthirsty warlords that once dominated the region - perhaps their appearance isn’t a bad thing. However, the rulers of the world must be wary. The Khitan aren’t the first horde to attack the region, nor will they be the last. A more brutal, ruthless, and inhuman horde of warriors may yet appear from the far east in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.3.a;Ha ha, that last one was a good joke. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.4.desc;Some Khitan refugees, fleeing from the murderous, traitorous, dishonorable Jurchen, have made their way to our court. They are wary from their journey, but their loyalty to the Khitan cause is undeniable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.4.a;I am glad they made it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.5.desc;Amazing news! Members of your dynasty, the great Yelu clan, have made it to your court. They tell you their riveting tale of how they escape the monstrous Jurchen and made their way to you. Now, they hope that under your guidance you can bring the Khitan great honor. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.5.a;We shall avenge our defeat in China!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhongguo.5.b;Too much family might not be too good... let them settle elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
