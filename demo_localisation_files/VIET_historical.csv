VIEThistorical.0.desc;This land we rule was once dominated by the Picts. However, the Picts are in decline. Their numbers are few, their culture is a remnant of its former glory - in due time, some say, the Pictish people will disappear off the face of the earth! Regardless of whether that will be true or not, it is undeniable that many people no longer call this land "Pictland." Instead, they have begun to call it "Scotland" after the Scottish Gaels who now rule over it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIEThistorical.1.desc;The former Frankish territories of Neustria are now ruled by the descendants of Norse raiders called the Normans. As such, it will no longer be known as Neustria, and henceforth will be called "Normandy" after these Normans. Many look warily upon these Normans, a force to be reckoned with, for they blend the sophisticated culture of Rome with the militant traditions of the Germanic peoples. Perhaps one day they will do great things, perhaps even control entire kingdoms. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;x
