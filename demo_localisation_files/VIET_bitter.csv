VIETmisc.2010.desc;I tripped and fell down on the stairs! Thank heavens I'm okay - I just have a few bruises. My doctor said I should treat it with chicory, which I hate because of its bitter taste. Though I won't be eating it, having to deal with it is just annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2010.a;But I don't want my bruises to get worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2011.desc;Since I rule over a large Greek population I eat quite a lot of Greek food. I've found that the Greeks love eating khorta, or greens, a bitter mix of plants and herbs. It is extremely bitter though. I don't know if I can ever get used to it...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2011.a;Bitter foods can be tasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2011.b;Forget this Greek filth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2012.desc;Coffee. No man can live without it, where we are, myself included. It is a natural part of our diet. Most drink it bitter, but some make it sweet by adding sugar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2012.a;I prefer my coffee bitter, as is custom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2012.b;Sweet coffee is better. Without it it's too bitter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2013.desc;Bitter! Olives can't be this bitter, who can eat them? How will anyone make olive oil? It seems the stock of olives I bought were too raw.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2013.a;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2014.desc;I've ate a lot of arugula lately in my salads. No wonder I've been feeling so... stimulated in certain ways. People say it's an aphrodisiac after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2014.a;Good! Maybe this will last a long time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2014.b;I should eat cabbages, which will calm me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2015.desc;Spinach may taste bitter, but I eat it because I've found it makes me feel healthier and stronger. (I've heard rumors of a less bitter spinach in faraway lands, though.);;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2015.a;I'm strong to the finish because I eat my spniach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
popeye_spinach_eater;You become healthier than most. (+0.5 health);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_tried_something_new;Tried Something New;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_feeling_sexy;Excited and Stimulated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_feeling_sexy_desc;This character is feeling a bit more "stimulated" than normal. Their lover(s) better beware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
