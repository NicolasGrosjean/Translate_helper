ancrel.3400.title;The First Academy Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3400.desc;Centuries after Plato's Academy was shuttered by the Emperor Justinian, [From.GetTitledName] has restored the ancient center of learning to its former glory, establishing it as the center of Promethean philosophy and faith. The Scholarch of the First Academy will lead the Promethean faithful in religious and scholarly matters. This ushers in a new era of Promethean dominance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3400.a;Let it shine as a beacon of enlightenment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3400.b;Let its holy fires never darken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3400.c;Distressing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CHRONICLE_FIRST_ACADEMY;[Root.GetFullName] rebuilt The First Academy and established a new Scholarch to lead the Promethean Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3402.desc;The province of [From.GetName], devestated after its conquest by your armies, has been slowly settled since then by people from your realm. The majority of its inhabitants are now [This.Culture.GetName] and [This.Religion.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3403.desc;Now that you've come of age, it is time to decide which of the three great philosophical disciplines will you adhere to. This is an important decision in the life of every Promethean. It is not to be made lightly, nor can it be changed on a whim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3403.a;Stoicism is my guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3403.b;Skepticism is the way to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3403.c;Epicureanism is the path to Henosis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3404.desc;If there is one thing all three schools of thought within our faith agree on, in substance if not degree, it is that we must always question. To that end, you have begun to question the teachings of your current school. To which of the other two shall you turn your thoughts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.3411.title;Crotone Construction Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3411.desc;Long has the ancient Pythagorean Academy at Crotone lain in ruins. But no more! You have invested significant resources into restoring this once great center of learning. From the ruins will arise a new Crotone Academy to bring enlightenment to the Western Mediterranean and spread the light of Prometheus' wisdom to all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3411.a;It will be the greatest Academy yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3412.title;Crotone Academy of...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3412.desc;Your architects report that the work on Crotone is coming along famously, the foundations are solid and most of the support structures are complete. However, they wish to know what sort of Academy Crotone will be. This will determine what sort of facilities they will need to build, and it will determine what kind of students will come out of the school.\nWhat are your orders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3412.a;It will be a school of the arts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3412.b;It shall be a school of engineering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3412.c;It shall be a school of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3413.title;Crotone Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3413.desc;The Academy of Crotone is complete! Standing within the Shrine of the Brothers, you look out across the campus. Glittering marble and granite buildings arrayed in perfect geometry, carefully manicured lawns and shrubbery. Truly, this is form and function as one. As you light the Holy Fires of Prometheus in the shrine, opening the school for enrollment, the crowd cheers. This is a glorious day for Prometheans everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3413.a;Let the enlightenment begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3414.title;Academy Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3414.desc;Word has reached you that the Ancient Academy of Crotone, located on a Sicilian peninsula, ruined for centuries, has been rebuilt by [From.GetTitledName]. Resplendent in polished marble and granite, it's buildings can be seen for miles. The campus itself is so massive as to practically be a city unto itself, and can support ten thousand students. This shining beacon of Promethean ideals will no doubt strengthen their grip on the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3414.a;Glory to the Brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3414.b;This is troubling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Unbinding Festival Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3450.desc;The Unbinding Festival is a time for all Prometheans to come together and celebrate their shared philosophy. To put aside their differences and celebrate the release of Prometheus, the Enlightened One. Soon people from all across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName] will be traveling to the capitol for your festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3450.a;We must begin preperations at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3451.desc;The first decision you must make is how much to spend on the opening ceremony? Obviously, the more expensive the ceremony, the prestigious it will be for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3451.a;Lets not waste, simply rent a theatre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3451.b;Build a nice stage in the city square.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3451.c;Prometheus was chained to a mountain, I want a mountain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3452.desc;While the opening ceremony is the main event, the bulk of the Unbinding Festival is the festival itself. Firedancers and actors perform for the crowds while sculptors and painters create works of art in honor of our gods, and orators tell the stories of our past so we do not repeat our mistakes. Better performers will cost more coin. How much should we spend on the festivities?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3452.a;Lets keep it simple, don't empty the treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3452.b;We don't want to be cheap, but lets not overdo it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3452.c;This will be a festival to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3453.desc;It is the ruler's place to decide who will play the parts of Prometheus and Heracles during the opening ceremony. Traditionally the role of Prometheus is filled by the [Root.job_spiritual.GetJobTitle], but you may choose yourself, someone of exceptional [Root.Religion.GetPietyName], or anyone at all to fill the role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3453.a;I shall take the role of Prometheus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3453.b;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] shall perform this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3453.c;I will choose someone of great [Root.Religion.GetPietyName] for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3453.d;I don't really care... how about you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3454.desc;Now you must decide who shall play the role of Heracles. Traditionally this would be your [Root.job_marshal.GetJobTitle], but you can choose anyone you like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3454.a;I shall be mighty Heracles this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3454.b;[Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] will do their duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3454.c;I will choose someone prestigous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3454.d;I don't care, how about that one over there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.unbinding_prometheus;The Unbinding of Prometheus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3455.desc.prometheus;You lie on the false Mount Kazbek, chained to a stone. A puppet eagle is above you, its beak covered in gore. You hear the twang of a bow, and there at the edge of the stage is [festival_heracles.GetFirstName] as Heracles, wielding a bow and wearing a lions pelt. [festival_heracles.GetSheHeCap] recites the lines, "I have come to free you from your bondage, Enlightened One. Even Zeus can see now that your light can not be hidden forever." Heracles lifts his sword and breaks the chains.\nYou recite your lines, "Thank you Heracles, your name shall be honored for all time! Your labors have destroyed barbarism around the world, civilization owes you a great debt!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3455.desc.heracles;You step onto the stage and see [festival_prometheus.GetFirstName] as Prometheus bound to the false mountain, the puppet eagle perched above with crimson beak. You fire your empty bow, and the bird drops to the ground at the sound of its twang.\nYou speak, "I have come to free you from your bondage, Enlightened One. Even Zeus can see now that your light can not be hidden forever." You lift your sword and break the chains. Prometheus recites [festival_prometheus.GetHerHis] lines, "Thank you Heracles, your name shall be honored for all time! Your labors have destroyed barbarism around the world, civilization owes you a great debt!" The crowds roar with cheering and applause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3455.desc.other;You watch as [festival_prometheus.GetFullName] lies chained to the false mountain, an eagle with bloodstained beak perches above. You hear a twang, and the eagle falls to the ground. From behind a rock appears [festival_heracles.GetFullName], dressed in a lion's pelt and holding a bow. [festival_heracles.GetSheHeCap] strides forward and speaks, "I have come to free you from your bondage, Enlightened One. Even Zeus can see now that your light can not be hidden forever." With one swing of their sword, the chains are broken.\n[festival_prometheus.GetFirstName] speaks, "Thank you Heracles, your name shall be honored for all time! Your labors have destroyed barbarism around the world, civilization owes you a great debt!" The crowd roars with applause, and you cannot help but be caught up in the excitement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3455.a;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3456.a;A grand ceremony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3457.a;Prometheus smiles on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3458.a;I look good in fur...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3459.desc;It seems one of the firedancers you hired for the ceremony accidentally set fire to a building in the city! By the time the fires were put out the damage had been done, the structure is a smoking ruin. Thankfully, no one was hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3459.a;Clumsy bastards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3460.desc;You stand with a crowd, watching as firedancers perform in one of the city streets. The firedance is mesmerizing, and the crowd is nearly silent for the whole act. After what seems to have been minutes, or maybe hours, the dancers take a bow and the crowd cheers. One of your vassals, whom you hadn't noticed standing there, tells you how pleased they are with the firedancers this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3460.a;They were quite good, weren't they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3461.desc;You are walking through the streets when [From.GetTitledFirstName] catches your eye. [From.GetSheHe] is standing near an ongoing firedance, the light of the dancer's implements illuminating their face in a very captivating way. You feel you heart pump harder, desire filling your veins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3461.a;I must have [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3461.b;I'll just admire [From.GetHerHim] from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3461.c;Lust is for corporeal things, I must be more enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3464.desc;While watching a firedance, one of the performers gets too close and a gobbet of flaming paste hits you! You survive, but the damage is extensive.\nWhat will you do with the firedancer responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3464.a;Execute them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3464.b;They are a menace! Throw them into the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3464.c;The show must go on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3465.desc;While watching one of the firedancer performances at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s festival, a firedancer gets too close to the crowd and you are struck by their flaming instrument! You do not have the authority to decide punishment for the offenders, but you can make a recommendation to your liege...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3465.a;I demand that they be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3465.a.tt;Your liege hears your request...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3465.b;Accidents happen. I shall request leniency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3465.b.tt;Your liege hears your request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3466.desc;Your vassal, [From.GetTitledName], was involved in an accident with some firedancers and has been maimed! [From.GetSheHe] demands they be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3466.a;Execute all of the firedancers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3466.b;Remove the firedancers from the city, we can't have accidents like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3466.c;You're overreacting, it was just an accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3467.desc;One of your vassals, [From.GetTitledName], was maimed by a firedancer during an act. It appears to be an accident, and [From.GetFirstName] is requesting that you show leniency in light of this fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3467.a;Leniency? Nonesense! Execute them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3467.b;Fine, I will merely imprison them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3467.c;Agreed, accidents happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.remove_firedancers;This decision will mean that we will have no firedancers for the rest of this festival. It may upset the commoners, who are fond of the spectacle.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3470.desc;A troup of actors are performing the story of Prometheus and Epimetheus creating the worlds creatures from clay. The narrator is explaining how the nature of these first people, that of clay, meant they could only excel at manual labors when you hear [cynic.GetTitledFirstName] shout "That's absurd!" It seems [cynic.GetTitledFirstName]'s is arguing with [zealot.GetTitledFirstName] over the literal interpretation of the story. They both look to you to resolve the argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3470.a;It's clearly a metaphor, to teach school children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3470.b;It was Plato, I think, who once said...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3470.c;Um, I... gotta go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3470.d;Of course it's literal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3471.desc;You are watching a rather poor re-enactment of Prometheus' binding when the actor playing Prometheus begins to wail and beg for his freedom. This grave insult to their god, and terrible acting, whips the crowd into a fury. They can barely be kept from charging the stage. They pour into the streets and begin a small riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3471.a;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] protect us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3472.desc;A troup of actors are doing a re-enactment of Duecalion's Flood, and it's wonderful. While no one actor truly stood out, the troup as a whole performed amazingly. You can really feel the deep sadness of Duecalion and Pyrrha over the loss of their people and everything they knew, and the great joy of landfall and the creation of a new race of men. The crowds applause is deafening when the actors take their bows. The whole realm will be talking about this for months!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3472.a;Amazing! Truly wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3473.desc;During the entire festival you have heard rumors about a particularly brilliant actor, one with exceptional people skills and a disturbing knack for deception. Such an individual could be very useful in your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3473.a;Better they work for me than someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3473.b;I have no need for professional liars in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.desc;You are watching a play when, during a break before a pivotal scene, the lead gets on stage and requests that you perform his role in the next scene. The crowd is clapping and shouting encouragements. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.a;What? I can't get on stage, what if I make a fool of myself!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.b;Well, why not? I think I know the lines...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.b.tt;You get on stage and attempt to recite the lines from the play.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.c;I think I have an idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.c.tt;You get on stage and improvise. This could go very well, or very poorly...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3474.d;Ah, but you are doing so well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3475.desc;You remembered the lines perfectly and acted well, the crowd gives you a hearty applause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3475.a;I was good, wasn't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3476.desc;You got a line wrong, and your acting was so-so. Not everyone can be a star, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3476.a;Guess I shouldn't quit my day job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3477.desc;You skip several lines and speak two of them out of order, your acting is rather bad. The crowd seems like it would boo at you if it wasn't so embarrassed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3477.a;Oh, the shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3478.desc;Your improvised lines meet with booing and the ocassional piece of produce. The lead gently suggests you retire to the dressing rooms so he can take over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3478.a;Uncultured heathens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3479.desc;Your improvised lines meet with roaring applause! The actors all fall into your new performance as if it were planned, and the lot of you craft an entire new scene on stage. Afterwards the only thing anyone can talk about is your amazing performance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3479.a;I was born for the stage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3480.desc;A [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] tells of Pandora and the Jar. Prometheus gave Pandora curiosity, a laudable trait. But Zeus was glad, for he knew that no one had given her Caution. So he gave Pandora a jar which held all the troubles man now suffers. Curiosity overcame Pandora, and she opened the jar. Epimetheus helped her understand her mistake, giving her Caution. Epimetheus' gift is the ability to learn from our mistakes and grow beyond what the gods give us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3480.a;A wonderous gift, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3480.b;A useless gift, for I have no flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3481.desc;While roaming the square, you find a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] reciting the tale of Duecalion's Flood, they are nearly finished. "And they did as his father Prometheus instructed and cast stones over their shoulders. Duecalion's sprouted into men, and Pyrrha's into women. It is from these, and from Prometheus-born Duecalion and Epimetheus-born Pyrrha, that we all descend. And the metal ore in those stones gave us our talents and determine our castes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3481.a;I always liked that story...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3482.desc;As you wander through the fair you come upon a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] speaking of Enlightenment. They talk of moving beyond the shadow of this world and finding Oneness, true enlightenment where this world will seem as real as a child's drawing does to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3482.a;I hope to reach CHIM someday...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3482.b;What a bunch of nonesense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3483.desc;During the festival you've heard talk of a brilliant speaker and philosopher. Apparently they've bested many of your own [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] in matters of philosophy and won their grudging respect. Several of them are strongly encouraging you to invite this philosopher to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3483.a;Bring this great philosopher to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3483.b;I have no need for know-it-alls in my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3484.desc;An artist from a distant realm has taken to making unflattering portraits of you with exaggerated features. They are quite popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3484.a;I've got four already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3484.b;They look nothing like me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3484.c;I will not be made a fool of! Imprison this charlatan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3485.desc;A sculptor has crafted a masterful statue of Prometheus giving fire to humanity. Crowds have gathered to marvel at it, and several nobles are already starting a bidding war. Such a statue would look quite impressive in a courtyard or entrance hall...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3485.a;It's marvelous, but I have the realm to look after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3485.b;It is but a cheap immitation of the real thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3485.c;Shut up and take my drachma!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.desc;You are discussing the weather with [From.GetTitledFirstName] when you notice the sculptor behind [From.GetHerHim] has lost their balance and knocked their statue over. It is about to fall on you both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.a;"Get out of the way [From.GetFirstName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.a.tt;You warn [From.GetFirstName] before diving out of the way.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.b;Ahhhhhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.b.tt;You save your own skin.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.c;"I'll save you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3487.c.tt;You heroically save [From.GetFirstName], endangering yourself.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3488.desc;As you are discussing the weather with [From.GetTitledFirstName] you hear a grinding sound behind you. In that moment, [From.GetFirstName] shouts "Get out of the way!" and points behind you before diving away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3488.a;By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3489.desc;You were discussing the weather with [From.GetTitledFirstName] when you heard the sound of stone grinding on stone. The last thing you remember before a statue falls upon you is [From.GetFirstName] fleeing in terror...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3489.a;That coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3490.desc;You were discussing the weather with [From.GetTitledFirstName] when you heard a strange grinding behind you. The next thing you know, [From.GetFirstName] has thrown you to the ground out of harms way, and the statue has collapsed onto [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3490.a;[From.GetSheHe]'s a hero!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3491.desc;An artist from a foreign land has just finished a mural and is revealing it for the first time. The gathered crowd is buzzing with excitement... at least until the cover is removed. The quality is excellent, but liberties were taken. The mural depicts Promethia and Epimethia, and he calls it "The Sisters." The crowd is, to put it lightly, incensed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3492.desc;As you stand in the city square watching a firedance, the light of the performance barely illuminating the dark corner of the plaza, [From.GetTitledFirstName], your liege, whispers something... carnal, into your ear. [From.GetSheHeCap] is attempting to seduce you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3541.desc;Due to the ongoing conflict, [From.GetTitledFirstName] must cancel the Unbinding Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3542.desc;Due to the ongoing conflict, you must cancel the Unbinding Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.3550.title;Men of Steel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.3550.desc;In response to a growing need to defend Promethean interests against the 'un-enlightened', [From.GetTitledName] has created an elite fighting force, the Men of Steel. In Promethean society, the military caste is known as the 'Men of Iron', the Men of Steel are formed from the elite members of the Iron caste. Forged in the heat of battle, these warriors of Prometheus will face any foe that threatens their ways with cunning and bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
