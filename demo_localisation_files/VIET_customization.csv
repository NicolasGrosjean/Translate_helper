#Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
customization.0.desc;This menu will allow you to change the name of various realms, such as the Byzantine Empire. Note that the last option is always the default.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.1.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Byzantine Empire is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Byzantine Empire” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Byzantine Empire (default)”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.2.desc;If you wish to see the earlier options, temporarily choose one of the following, then activate the “Choose Realm Names” decision again.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.desc;This event allows you to turn childbirth mortality on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that newborns and their mothers have a small chance of dying following childbirth - sometimes one or the other, rarely both. This is to make gameplay more exciting, unpredictable, and realistic.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3;Normally, in VIET, mothers and children can die in childbirth - turn this on or off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.a;Turn childbirth mortality off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.b;Turn childbirth mortality on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.desc;This event allows you to turn the old age modifier on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that older characters are less capable than their younger counterparts. This is to make older characters die off earlier, unlike in vanilla where they lived too long. This will NOT remove existing old age modifiers!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4;Normally, in VIET, old characters have an increasingly higher chance of suffering from the effects of old age - turn this on or off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.a;Turn Old Age off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.b;Turn Old Age on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.5.desc;This menu will allow you enable or disable VIET's various war and CB tweaks and changes to your liking. Note that other changes may still apply! You can always change these settings if you change your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.6.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent Orthodox holy wars on Muslims, and whether for all Orthodoxy or only yourself. Other restrictions still apply. By default, Orthodox rulers can only declare holy war on pagans, as historically the Orthodox church didn’t have a tradition of holy war like Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.7.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent Republics from declaring holy wars, and whether for all Republics or only yourself. Other restrictions still apply. By default, Republics cannot declare holy wars - Republics should be more interested than trade than religious war, and this is also to prevent Republic blobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.desc;This event allows you to turn the young age modifier on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that characters younger than 6-10 are weaker and more susceptible to illness. It works alongside childbirth mortality to make childhood more perilous. This will NOT remove existing young age modifiers!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.a;Turn Young Age off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.b;Turn Young Age on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.9.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Kingdom of Spain (Empire of Hispania in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kingdom of Spain” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kingdom of Spain”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.10.desc;This menu will allow you to enable or disable new mechanics specific to cultures or religions. By default, all mechanics are enabled. If you want to disable something, it is best that you disable it at the very beginning of a campaign, rather than mid-game, as there may be unintended effects, though nothing gamebreaking.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.11.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable Turkish features. Turkish features include the Turkish Conquest CB, the formation of the Turkish Empire for Turks who have captured Constantinople, as well as the Turkish Practical Trade system for king or emperor-tier Turkish lords and their relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.12.desc;This menu will allow you to enable or disable certain sets of flavor events in VIET. By default, all of these events are enabled. If you disable them, they will not randomly occur. You can always turn them on and off without serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.13.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable events with overly blatant Elder Scrolls references, such as the one about getting an injury from a flying projectile in a certain body part. It’s for those who don’t want overused memes in their CKII game and don’t like VIET’s usage of them. :(;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.14.desc;This event allows you enable/disable W. African features, including the Griot system, various decisions (like the Iron Woman and Griot performance decisions) and other miscellaneous W. African features. It will not disable (most) W. African flavor events.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.15.desc;If you wish to see the earlier options, temporarily choose one of the following, then activate the “Choose Realm Names” decision again.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.16.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent non-Christian Republics from using coastal CBs. Other restrictions still apply. By default, non-Christian Republics cannot use these to prevent blobbing as they have other avenues for expansion (such as Muslim Invasion or Pagan Subjugation).;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.17.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Kingdom of Britain (Empire of Britannia in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kingdom of Britain” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kingdom of Britain”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.18.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable Finnish Pagan features, including various Finnish Pagan decisions, karsikko markings, and the Haltija system. Note that the Shaman system will still function for the Tengri Pagans unless you’ve disabled Tengri features as well.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.19.desc;More options.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.20.desc;This event will allow you to choose what name the Kalmar Union (Empire of Scandinavia in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kalmar Union” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kalmar Union”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.26.desc;Some more options for you. If you want to go back to the first menu, choose the “Never mind” option and then go back to these events via the decisions menu.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.27.desc;This event will allow you to choose what name Poland-Lithuania (Wendish Empire in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Poland-Lithuania” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Poland-Lithuania”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.28.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable holy war and republic CB cooldowns. If they disabled, the game will still give you the cooldown modifier, but it will ignore it for the requirements. Note that other restrictions may still apply to the CBs. By default, certain CBs cannot be declared while the cooldown timer is still in effect.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.29.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable the pagan province holy war restriction. Other holy war restrictions still apply. By default, non-pagans cannot declare holy war if they hold any province that is pagan and not of their culture, unless the target is also of their culture.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.30.desc;This event will allow you to choose what name the Empire of Carpathia is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Carpathia” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Carpathia”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.31.desc;More options.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.32.desc;This event allows you to change the rate of culture conversion. Note that other factors still apply afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.33.desc;This event allows you to change the rate of religious conversion. Note that other factors still apply afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.34.desc;These events allow you to turn on, turn off, or randomize various horde invasions. For randomized invasions, you can keep re-firing the event to change your roll of dice, so to speak. Obviously, these events have to be fired before the invasions. Regardless, which invasions would you like to change?;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.35.desc;This event will change the chances the Mongols - both the Ilkhanate and Golden Horde - will appear. Due to the way the code for the Mongol invasions work, both hordes will be affected (i.e. they will either appear together, or none of them will appear) - there’s no easy way to do each of them separately, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.36.desc;This event will change the chances the Seljuks will appear.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.37.desc;This event will change the chances the Timurids will appear.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.38.desc;This event will change the chances ALL hordes will appear. It affects all hordes at once - i.e., if you choose “10% (low chance of appearing)” there is a 10% chance ALL the hordes will appear and 90% that NONE of them will appear. If you want to change them separately, use the other horde customization options.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.39.desc;These events allow you to change the rate of province culture or religious conversions.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.39.a;Change culture conversion rate;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.39.b;Change religion conversion rate;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.40.desc;More options.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.41.desc;More options.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.42.desc;This event will change the chances the Aztecs will appear. Obviously, it won't do anything if you don't have Sunset Invasion activated.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.43.desc;This event will allow you to remove all customization options from the decisions menu - you won't be able to access them. Ever. This option is for those who find the customization options immersion-breaking. If you wish to want to re-enable customization options, type "event customization.45" in the console which will trigger an event.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.44.desc;Are you really sure? :(\n(Remember about typing "event customization.45" into the console if you change your mind. (Although it wouldn't be possible on ironman...));;;;;;;;;;;
customization.45.desc;Ha! I told you you'd miss those customization options! :p;;;;;;;;;;;
are_you_really_sure_customization_options;Are you really sure?;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.46.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Empire of Francia is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Francia” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Francia” (default)”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.47.desc;More options.\n\n(By the way, I like my french bread soft.);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.48.desc;This event will change the chances the Ghaznavids will appear.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.49.desc;This "cheat" event allows you to set the Silk Road's prosperity level. For instance, from 1066 starts onward, it has a prosperity level of 0, meaning it can't be revived. At level 1 or 2, it can be revived, but it'll take some work. At level 3, the Silk Road has revived. BE CAREFUL WITH THESE, only change these if you know how they work!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.50.desc;More options.\n\nSilk Road ahoy!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.51.desc;xxxx;;;;;;;;;;;
